## Intent

This website is about one particularly difficult problem. 

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

For some video game with a sufficiently rich environment,
create automated Non-Player Characters <SideNote>A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by a Player.</SideNote>
collectively indistinguishable from human controlled characters.
</Card>

We need to clarify what we mean.

What is a video game?
Answer: a simulation of _sensation_ (sight, sounds) and _action_ (character controls, collision detection).
A _Player_ is a human experiencing this simulation, and also their respective simulated avatar.
A Non-Player character (_NPC_) is a simulated being not controlled by a Player.
There may be one or more Players, and they are the observers of the NPCs.
The underlying problem requires each NPC to behave like its being controlled by a human playing a particular role.
Individuals needn't be particularly intelligent (e.g. multiple choice dialogue), but they must collectively interact just like humans would.

{/* To better understand our objectives let us place them in the context of an underlying problem. */}
{/* Although we won't try to solve it directly, we will work towards an intermediate problem. */}

Simulations of human behaviour recently took a step forwards.
Chat Bots can now converse in a flexible and meaningful manner <SideNote>Putting aside their so-called _hallucinations_ and somewhat memoryless nature.</SideNote>.
But before we reach towards Artificial General Intelligence,
consider Non-Player Characters. 
Nowadays the word _NPC_ is used to insult someone who [does not think for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).
Popular films depict them as conversationally rigid,
usually with a single linear conversation <SideNote>The Jumanji reboot [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle) and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level).</SideNote>.
In our search for intelligent machines, we should remember that Turing's test was a _party game_.
Almost 75 years later we have a multi-billion dollar video game industry,
and a distinct lack of believable NPCs.

Then let's do something about it.

First of all,
we're going to approach the <ScrollTo id="underlying-problem">underlying problem</ScrollTo> like a sneak thief.
A head-on approach is way too hard.
The video game industry has many talented developers, and there's no reason to believe we can do any better.
To make progress we're going to move the goal posts.
We still want NPCs to collectively behave like humans.
However, we're going to assume _another_ human controls them i.e. the _Game Master_.
Then we have two objectives:

<Card>
**Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable one human (the _Game Master_) to act indistinguishably from many humans.
</Card>

The first amounts to building a system, whereas the second is a desired property.
Importantly we've already created the foundations of this system.
We'll explain in our next blog entry.

{/* Why aren't we interested in the robots we have already invited into our homes i.e. NPCs? */}
{/* Take a step back. We're not ready yet. Lots of islands of ... */}


{/* Because video games must behave soundly over all user journeys,
so the [state space explosion problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) severely limits the number of states.
In other words, rich environments have a huge number of possibilities which cannot be anticipated by developers. */}

{/* A balance is needed between steering the Player along a narrative,
and allowing the Player to make free choices. */}


{/* For starters we won't work inside a video game development cycle i.e.
we're not trying to create some finished product which we can sell.
We're not trying to set an intricate clockwork world in motion.
Instead, ... */}

{/* Instead of setting an intricate clockwork world in motion,
let's react to the Player,
let's guide the Player,
let's experiment with the Player.
Then there are (at least) two human participants: the Player and the [_Game Master_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) (GM).
This motivates our objectives above i.e. the GM needs real-time control systems to drive the NPCs.
Then Turing's test shifts from _machine indistinguishable from human_ to _human indistinguishable from many Players_. */}


{/* But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"? */}

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
