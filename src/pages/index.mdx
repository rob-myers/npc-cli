## Intent

This website focuses on a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game where every Non-Player Character <SideNote>A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>
behaves just like a human-controlled character.
That is, the Player cannot distinguish the NPCs from human-controlled characters.
{/* where the Player cannot distinguish any Non-Player Character <SideNote>A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>
from human-controlled characters. */}
</Card>

There are some "immediate" ways to solve this.
We could restrict the possible _actions_ e.g. the classic point-and-click [Monkey Island 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_2:_LeChuck%27s_Revenge).
We could restrict or abstract the _environment_, for example Chess or Go.
We could even simply use humans to control every NPC.
{/* On the other hand, if possible actions included unrestricted textual chat yields [Turing's Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test),
which remains unsolved despite recent improvements in Chat Bots. */}

Let's clarify our terminology.
_Video games_ are entertaining simulations of sensation (sight, sounds) and action (character controls).
The _Player_ is both the human experiencing the simulation, and their respective simulated character.
A _Non-Player character_ (a.k.a. _NPC_) is a simulated character not controlled by the Player.
During the course of the video game, the Player observes and interacts with the NPCs,
and we're interested in improving the quality of these observations and interactions.

{/* We'll work in 3D, moving many characters around many rooms. */}

The underlying problem requires each NPC to behave as if controlled by a human playing a particular role.
Individuals needn't be sophisticated (e.g. multiple choice dialogue), but they must collectively interact just like humans would.

Ok, but why this particular problem?

Recently, simulations of human behaviour have taken a step forwards.
Chat Bots can now converse in an apparently flexible and meaningful manner <SideNote>Putting aside their so-called _hallucinations_ and somewhat memoryless nature.</SideNote>.
But before aiming for Artificial General Intelligence,
consider Non-Player Characters. 
Nowadays the word _NPC_ is used to insult someone who [does not think for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).
Popular films depict them as conversationally rigid,
usually with a single linear conversation <SideNote>The Jumanji reboot [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle) and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level).</SideNote>.
In our search for intelligent machines, we should remember that Turing's test was a _party game_.
Almost 75 years later we have a multi-billion dollar video game industry
and a distinct lack of believable NPCs.
It seems that society's interest in robots
does not extend to the ones we've already invited into our homes.

So let's do something about it.


We're not going to attack the <ScrollTo id="underlying-problem">underlying problem</ScrollTo> directly.
A head-on approach is way too hard.
The video game industry has many talented developers, artists and designers, and there's no reason to believe we can do any better.
To make progress we're going to move the goal posts.
We still want NPCs to behave like humans from the Player's perspective.
However, we're going to assume _another_ human controls them i.e. the _Game Master_.
Then we have two objectives:

<Card>
**Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable the Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans.
</Card>

The first objective amounts to building a system,
whereas the second is a property this system must satisfy.
Collectively they would solve the underlying problem from the Player's perspective (assuming it's entertaining).
The next problem might be to automate the Game Master, but that's out of scope.
This website is entirely focused on the two objectives listed above.
Importantly we've already created the system's foundations,
as we shall explain in our next blog entry.


{/* Because video games must behave soundly over all user journeys,
so the [state space explosion problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) severely limits the number of states.
In other words, rich environments have a huge number of possibilities which cannot be anticipated by developers. */}

{/* A balance is needed between steering the Player along a narrative,
and allowing the Player to make free choices. */}

{/* For starters we won't work inside a video game development cycle i.e.
we're not trying to create some finished product which we can sell.
We're not trying to set an intricate clockwork world in motion.
Instead, ... */}

{/* Instead of setting an intricate clockwork world in motion,
let's react to the Player,
let's guide the Player,
let's experiment with the Player.
Then there are (at least) two human participants: the Player and the [_Game Master_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) (GM).
This motivates our objectives above i.e. the GM needs real-time control systems to drive the NPCs.
Then Turing's test shifts from _machine indistinguishable from human_ to _human indistinguishable from many Players_. */}


{/* But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"? */}

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
