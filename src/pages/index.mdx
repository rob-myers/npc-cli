## Intent

This website has a single underlying objective:

> to make video game characters more believable.

Does this problem need to be solved?
Certainly from a personal perspective: I find NPCs to be (a) shallow, and (b) mostly narrative devices or pointers to other gameplay.
Here's another reason.
With all the latest _brouhaha_ surrounding AI,
why has _NPC_ <SideNote>Foo</SideNote> arisen as a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves?
In a virtual world we do not need to solve a multitude of hard sensory/effector-based problems.


Here are some icons:
- <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faChevronRight} size="1x" />
- <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} size="1x" />
- <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLungs} size="1x" />

export { Head } from '../components/Head'
