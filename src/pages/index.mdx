## Intent

This website has two objectives.

<Card>
**Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs <SideNote>NPC stands for "Non-Player Character" i.e. a video game character not controlled by a (human) Player.</SideNote>.
2. Enable one human to act indistinguishably from many Players.
</Card>

Here we're talking about video games.
They simulate _sensation_ (sight and sounds) and _identity_ (character controls, collision detection, [skins](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins/random)).
You temporarily _become_ something, whose sensory input and possible actions reflect your virtual position and state.
But it's not much fun without other beings, either humans or more commonly Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
{/* To understand our objectives, more background is needed. */}
{/* Intelligent machines have long had a place in our hearts and minds. */}

Amazingly and quite unexpectedly, Chat Bots can now hold flexible and meaningful conversations <SideNote>Putting aside their hallucinations and somewhat memoryless nature.</SideNote>.
But before reaching towards Artificial General Intelligence,
consider the current state of NPCs.
The word _NPC_ is now used to insult someone who [does not think for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).
Popular films depict them as conversationally rigid and predictable,
usually with a single linear conversation <SideNote>The Jumanji reboot [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle) and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level).</SideNote>.
In our search for intelligent machines, we should remember that Turing's test was a _party game_.
Almost 75 years later we have a multi-billion dollar video game industry,
and a distinct lack of flexible or believable NPCs.

<Card> 
**Background Problem**

In a video game with a sufficiently rich environment,
develop Non-Player Characters which are indistinguishable from Players.
<SideNote width={400}>This is Turing's test relative to the particulars of the video game e.g. multiple-choice dialog.</SideNote>
</Card>

ðŸš§ WIP

This problem provides our underlying motivation.
On the other hand, it seems way too hard to attack directly.
Currently there are no video games in existence that even come close.
Although the "intelligence" of NPCs is often emphasized in marketing blurb, it pretty much _never_ lives up to our expectations.
That's because it's a really difficult problem.
It's too hard to solve within the confines of video game development cycles.
Why?

> Because video games must behave soundly over all user journeys,
> so the [state space explosion problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) severely limits the number of states.

In other words, rich environments have a huge number of possibilities which cannot be anticipated by developers.
Instead of tackling this problem head on, we'll work towards an intermediate solution.
For starters we won't work inside a video game development cycle i.e.
we're not trying to create some finished product which we can sell.
We're not trying to set an intricate clockwork world in motion.
Instead, ...


{/* Instead of setting an intricate clockwork world in motion,
let's react to the Player,
let's guide the Player,
let's experiment with the Player.
Then there are (at least) two human participants: the Player and the [_Game Master_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) (GM).
This motivates our objectives above i.e. the GM needs real-time control systems to drive the NPCs.
Then Turing's test shifts from _machine indistinguishable from human_ to _human indistinguishable from many Players_. */}


{/* But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"? */}

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
