## Intent

This website has a single underlying objective:

> to make video game characters more believable.

Does this problem need to be solved?
Certainly from a personal perspective: I find NPCs <SideNote>_NPC_ stands for Non-Player Character</SideNote> to be (a) shallow, and (b) mostly narrative devices or pointers to other gameplay.
Here's another reason.
With all the latest _brouhaha_ surrounding AI <SideNote>Yes, Large Language Models are amazing. No, we're nowhere near Artificial General Intelligence.</SideNote>,
why has _NPC_ arisen as a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves?
In a virtual world we do not need to solve a multitude of hard sensory/effector-based problems.
Yet have we seen significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Not really.
