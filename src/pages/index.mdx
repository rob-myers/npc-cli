## Intent

This website has two objectives:

> 1. Build flexible real-time control systems for NPCs <SideNote>_NPC_ stands for "Non-Player Character" i.e. a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>.
> 2. Enable a single human to act indistinguishably from many human Players.

Video games simulate _identity_ (character controls, collision detection, [skins](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins/random)) and _sensation_ (sight and sounds).
You temporarily _become_ something, whose sensory input and possible actions reflect your virtual position and state.
But it's not much fun without other beings, either humans or more commonly Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
This brings us to our objectives, but first some background is in order.

Intelligent machines have long had a place in our hearts and minds.
Amazingly, Chat Bots can now hold meaningful conversations in a flexible way <SideNote>Putting aside their hallucinations and somewhat memoryless nature.</SideNote>.
But those believing Artificial General Intelligence is within reach
should consider the current state of NPCs.
Nowadays, the word NPC is used to insult someone who [does not think for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).
Popular films depict them as conversationally [rigid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle) and [predictable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level), usually with a single linear conversation.
In our search for intelligent machines, we should remember that Turing's test was a _party game_.
Almost 75 years later there is a multi-billion dollar video game industry,
and yet malleable and believable characters are in very short supply.

{/* Not fault of Game dev because they work in Game industry. Leads us to objectives */}
{/* Despite avoiding difficult sensor/effector engineering problems, */}

ðŸš§ WIP

Importantly, there are other reasons we should solve this problem.
Concerning the latest _brouhaha_ surrounding AI <SideNote>Yes, Large Language Models are amazing. No, we're nowhere near Artificial General Intelligence.</SideNote>,
then why has NPC become a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves?
Virtual worlds avoid a multitude of difficult sensory and effector-based problems.
But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
We should remember that Turing's Test was actually a _party game_ where a man had to pretend to be a woman.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"?

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
