## Intent

This website has two objectives:

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs <SideNote>_NPC_ stands for "Non-Player Character" i.e. a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>.
2. Enable one human to be indistinguishable from many Players.

Video games simulate _sensation_ (sight and sounds) and _identity_ (character controls, collision detection, [skins](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins/random)).
You temporarily _become_ something, whose sensory input and possible actions reflect your virtual position and state.
But it's not much fun without other beings, either humans or more commonly Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
{/* To understand our objectives, more background is needed. */}
{/* Intelligent machines have long had a place in our hearts and minds. */}

Amazingly, Chat Bots can now hold flexible and meaningful conversations <SideNote>Putting aside their hallucinations and somewhat memoryless nature.</SideNote>.
But before reaching towards Artificial General Intelligence,
consider the current state of NPCs.
The word _NPC_ is now used to insult someone who [does not think for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).
Popular films depict them as conversationally rigid and predictable,
usually with a single linear conversation <SideNote>The Jumanji reboot [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle) and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level).</SideNote>.
In our search for intelligent machines, we should remember that Turing's test was a _party game_.
Almost 75 years later we have a multi-billion dollar video game industry (actually hundreds of billions),
but a distinct lack of flexible or believable NPCs.

How can we work towards a solution?
How can we strive towards the NPCs Turing hoped for?
We believe the problem is _too hard_.
At least, it's too hard to solve within the confines of video game development cycles.
Why?

> Because video games must behave soundly over all user journeys,
> so the [state space explosion problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) severely limits the number of states.

That is, rich environments have a huge number of possibilities which cannot be anticipated by developers.
Instead of tackling this problem head-on we'll work towards an intermediate solution.
We won't work inside a video game development cycle i.e.
we're not trying to create some finished product which we can sell.


ðŸš§ WIP

Instead of setting an intricate clockwork world in motion,
let's react to the Player,
let's guide the Player,
let's experiment with the Player.
Then there are (at least) two human participants: the Player and the [_Game Master_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) (GM).
This motivates our objectives above i.e. the GM needs real-time control systems to drive the NPCs.
Then Turing's test shifts from _machine indistinguishable from human_ to _human indistinguishable from many Players_.


{/* But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"? */}

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
