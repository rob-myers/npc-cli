## Intent

This website has a single underlying objective:

> to make video game characters more believable.

Is this a real problem?
Does it actually need to be solved?
Well,
I usually find NPCs <SideNote>_NPC_ stands for "Non-Player Character" i.e. a character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> to be narrative devices (story unwinding), pointers to other gameplay (like quest givers), short-lived enemies, or partially-controllable extensions of the Player.
I have never experienced an NPC respond flexibly to my actions, or to those of others.
It seems strange that a medium with such great potential for _character development_ cannot hold a candle to great books, or great films.
Then from the perspective of entertainment, or the medium's potential as an art form,
there is a real problem.

But there are other reasons we should solve this problem.
Given the latest _brouhaha_ surrounding AI <SideNote>Yes, Large Language Models are amazing. No, we're nowhere near Artificial General Intelligence.</SideNote>,
then why has _NPC_ become a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves?
Virtual worlds avoid a multitude of difficult sensory/effector-based problems.
But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Not really.
Games like Fallout (1997), Quake (1996), GTA (1997) and Thief 2 (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
