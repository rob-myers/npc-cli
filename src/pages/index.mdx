## Intent

This site is driven by a difficult problem. 

<Card> 
**Underlying Problem**

For some video game with a sufficiently rich environment,
create Non-Player Characters <SideNote>A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by a Player.</SideNote>
collectively indistinguishable from human Players.
</Card>

Video games simulate _sensation_ (sight and sounds) and _identity_ (character controls, collision detection, [skins](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins/random)).
You temporarily _become_ something, whose sensory input and possible actions reflect your virtual position and state.
But things soon get stale without other beings, either humans or more commonly Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
The underlying problem asks for NPCs indistinguishable from humans, relative to the game environment.
Individuals needn't be particularly intelligent (e.g. multiple choice dialogue), but they must collectively interact just like humans would.
{/* To better understand our objectives let us place them in the context of an underlying problem. */}
{/* Although we won't try to solve it directly, we will work towards an intermediate problem. */}

Recently, machines with human behaviour took a big step forwards.
Chat Bots can now hold flexible and meaningful conversations <SideNote>Putting aside their hallucinations and somewhat memoryless nature.</SideNote>.
But before we reach towards Artificial General Intelligence,
consider Non-Player Characters. 
These days the word _NPC_ is used to insult someone who [does not think for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPC_(meme)).
Popular films depict them as conversationally rigid,
usually with a single linear conversation <SideNote>The Jumanji reboot [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_Welcome_to_the_Jungle) and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level).</SideNote>.
In our search for intelligent machines, we should remember that Turing's test was a _party game_.
Almost 75 years later we have a multi-billion dollar video game industry,
and a distinct lack of believable NPCs.

So let's do something about it.

Importantly, we won't tackle the underlying problem directly. 
It's just too hard.
The video game industry has always attracted talented developers, and there's no reason to believe we can do any better than they have.
To make progress we're going to move the goal posts.
We still want the denizens of a fabricated world to collectively behave like humans.
However, we're going to make a human control them. 
Then this website has two objectives:

<Card>
**Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable one human to act indistinguishably from many Players.
</Card>

ðŸš§ WIP

{/* Why aren't we interested in the robots we have already invited into our homes i.e. NPCs? */}
{/* Take a step back. We're not ready yet. Lots of islands of ... */}

> Why?
>
> Because video games must behave soundly over all user journeys,
> so the [state space explosion problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) severely limits the number of states.

In other words, rich environments have a huge number of possibilities which cannot be anticipated by developers.
A balance is needed between steering the Player along a narrative,
and allowing the Player to make free choices.
Instead of tackling this problem head on, we'll work towards an intermediate solution.
Then this website has two objectives.

<Card>
**Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable one human to act indistinguishably from many Players.
</Card>


{/* For starters we won't work inside a video game development cycle i.e.
we're not trying to create some finished product which we can sell.
We're not trying to set an intricate clockwork world in motion.
Instead, ... */}

{/* Instead of setting an intricate clockwork world in motion,
let's react to the Player,
let's guide the Player,
let's experiment with the Player.
Then there are (at least) two human participants: the Player and the [_Game Master_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) (GM).
This motivates our objectives above i.e. the GM needs real-time control systems to drive the NPCs.
Then Turing's test shifts from _machine indistinguishable from human_ to _human indistinguishable from many Players_. */}


{/* But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"? */}

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
