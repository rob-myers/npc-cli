## Intent

This website has two objectives:

> 1. Build flexible real-time control systems for NPCs <SideNote>_NPC_ stands for "Non-Player Character" i.e. a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>.
> 2. Enable a single human to act indistinguishably from many human Players.

Video games simulate _identity_ (character controls, collision detection, [skins](https://namemc.com/minecraft-skins/random)) and _sensation_ (sight and sounds).
You temporarily _become_ something, whose sensory input and possible actions reflect your virtual position and state.
But it's not much fun without other beings, either humans or more commonly Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

Intelligent machines are a popular topic in novels and films.
Outside entertainment, Chat Bots can hold meaningful conversations in a flexible way.
But to those who say Artificial General Intelligence is just around the corner,
I suggest they look at the current state of NPCs.
Virtual worlds avoid difficult real world sensor/effector based problems,
yet NPC has become a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves.
Turing's test was actually a party game where a computer had to pretend to be a woman.
Here we are almost 75 years later with a multi-billion dollar video game industry,
with not much to show for it.

{/* Not fault of Game dev because they work in Game industry. Leads us to objectives */}

ðŸš§ WIP

Importantly, there are other reasons we should solve this problem.
Concerning the latest _brouhaha_ surrounding AI <SideNote>Yes, Large Language Models are amazing. No, we're nowhere near Artificial General Intelligence.</SideNote>,
then why has NPC become a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves?
Virtual worlds avoid a multitude of difficult sensory and effector-based problems.
But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
We should remember that Turing's Test was actually a _party game_ where a man had to pretend to be a woman.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"?

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
