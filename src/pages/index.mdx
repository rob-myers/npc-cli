## Intent

This website has a single objective:

> to work towards believable NPCs <SideNote>An _NPC_ is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> by building flexible real-time control systems.

Is this a real problem?
Does it actually need to be solved?
Well,
I usually find NPCs <SideNote>_NPC_ stands for "Non-Player Character" i.e. a character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> to be either narrative devices (ways of unwinding the story), pointers to other gameplay (like quest givers), short-lived enemies, or partially-controllable extensions of the Player.
Rarely have I experienced an NPC responding flexibly to my actions, or to those of others.
It seems strange that a medium with such great potential for _character development_ cannot hold a candle to great books, or great films.
Then from the perspective of entertainment, or the medium's potential as an art form,
there is a real problem.

Importantly, there are other reasons we should solve this problem.
Concerning the latest _brouhaha_ surrounding AI <SideNote>Yes, Large Language Models are amazing. No, we're nowhere near Artificial General Intelligence.</SideNote>,
then why has NPC become a synonym for someone who does not think for themselves?
Virtual worlds avoid a multitude of difficult sensory and effector-based problems.
But have we seen really significant improvements in NPC behaviour over the last 20 years?
Games like _Fallout_ (1997), _Quake_ (1996), _GTA_ (1997) and _Thief 2_ (2000) still shine like the jewels they are.
Recent masterpieces like _The Last of Us Part II_ (2020) feel like finely-crafted refinements of old ideas.
We should remember that Turing's Test was actually a _party game_ where a man had to pretend to be a woman.
If we cannot produce believable character behaviour in the domain of entertainment,
why should we expect it within the additional constraints of "real life"?

{/* Finally as a way for us to understand our own behaviour */}
