# Background

Video games lack _interactive depth_.
- We can dress them in beautiful clothes (like films).
- We can wrap them in specific interfaces (like sports).
- We can drive them using narrative and characters (like books).

But there's something missing i.e. a sophisticated model of _Karma_.

By Karma we mean "actions have consequences".
More precisely, those actions _enacted by_ or _witnessed by_ the Player.
We do not mean "good actions yield good results" and "bad actions yield bad results".
We do not mean there is a navigable narrative state machine.
We do not mean a simulation of glorified clockwork toys.
So, what do we actually mean?

ðŸš§

The system involves three parties:
- the _Player_.
- the _Game Master_ (GM).
- the _Environment_ (Env).

The Player is human.
The GM is either human or a computer program i.e. a fabricated GM.
The Env is the underlying computer program where games are played/created by the Player/GM.

ðŸš§

Can we fabricate a GM which the Player thinks is human?

We can tackle this problem in the converse direction.
That is, we can focus on making human GMs more like programs.
If a human GM can react fluidly in realtime, we can write software which mimics or even learns this.
