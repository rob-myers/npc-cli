  - ✅ fixing resizing
  - ✅ add prop-passing via messaging
    - ✅ keep worker in another file
    - ✅ test patch
    - https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-offscreen/issues/8#issuecomment-1975397224

- ✅ non-terminal tab disabled when other tab maximized
  - TestWorker was showing when Tab was minimized

- ✅ Can Esc/Enter to enable/disable in Terminal/Tabs
- ✅ Terminal rendered using WebGL
  - fix HMR via `npm i xterm-addon-webgl` https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/4757

- ✅ abstract `TestWorld` as `TestCanvas`
  - ✅ `TestCanvas` has generic prop `childComponent` e.g. `Scene` not `<Scene />`
  - ✅ `TestCanvas` has prop `sceneProps` to be used as `<Scene {...sceneProps} />`
  - ✅ create test scene `TestCharacter` and hook up to `Viewer`

- ✅ Fix remount issue
  - `TestScene` was exporting `customQuadGeometry` which broke HMR

- ✅ geomorph 301 position slightly wrong?

- ❌ start "GeomorphEdit" in TestWorld
  - ✅ `TestWorld` -> `TestWorldScene` in `TestCanvas`
  - ✅ remove `TestWorld`
  - ❌ start map-level UI with `HTMLSelectElement`s
  - ✅ THREE gridHelper -> single quad infiniteGridHelper
    - fix jsx type
  - ❌ can detect click geomorphs or hull doors
  - ℹ️ use SVG editor instead, rep gms as e.g. 1200 * 1200 boxes

- ✅ `TestCanvas` has div ContextMenu shown on LongPress or RMB
    - ✅ when click outside scene
    - ✅ when click on floor in TestScene

- ✅ Don't use a web worker, here's why:
  - `<NPC>` should use react-three-fiber
  - But then js representation `state` inaccessible from main thread
  - TTY code runs in main thread, so would need another rep + communication
  - More generally would have to wrap THREE in a communication API.
  - We can return to "web worker approach" once the project is more mature

- ✅ can layout map using SVG with geomorph placeholders (rects)
  - ✅ create example layout svg
  - ✅ `symbols-meta.json` -> `assets-meta.json`
  - ✅ parse maps and store in `assets-meta.json`
  - ✅ why is loaded map "in wrong position" ?
    - was referencing stale prop
  - ✅ `TestScene` reads from JSON and updates onchange
    - requires window refocus
  - ✅ avoid window refocus
    - ✅ can extend gatsby with dev-only endpoints
    - ❌ endpoint `GET /dev-events` (for EventSource) and `POST /dev-files-changed`
    - ✅ create websocket server and test browser connect
      ```js
      const url = "ws://localhost:8012/echo"
      const wsClient = new WebSocket(url)
      wsClient.onmessage = e => console.log('message', e)
      wsClient.send(JSON.stringify({ yo: 'dawg' }))
      ```
    - ✅ can trigger websocket via curl
      ```sh
      curl -XPOST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        localhost:8012/send-dev-event \
        --data '{ "hello": "world!" }'
      ```
    - ✅ script assets-meta triggers websocket (if it exists)
    - ✅ browser triggers react-query refetch

- ✅ hull symbols have folder `symbols`, using placeholders
  - ℹ️ placeholders are partially transparent boxes of symbol filename's dimension
  - ✅ add stateroom symbol
  - ✅ extract during `yarn assets-meta`
  - ✅ maps: represent geomorph as single rect (via pattern)
  - ✅ clarify conversion { rect, transform } -> transform
  - ✅ compute affine transform we could apply to rect [0, 0, width, height]
    - ℹ️ want to eliminate rect.x, rect.y and transform-origin
      - let t_M be top-left of rect transformed under affine transform M
      - let t_S be top-left of [0, 0, rect.width, rect.height] transformed under 2x2 submatrix S of M
      - new affine transform is S plus translation (-t_{S,x} + t_{M,x}, -t_{S,y} + t_{M,y})

- ✅ maps parsing should support transform-origin too
  - ℹ️ can arise if rect starts with x, y attribs

- ✅ improve title

- ✅ fix HMR by moving consts elsewhere
- ✅ prevent multiple websocket connections on HMR

- ✅ New setup: `TestWorld` -> `TestWorldCanvas` -> `TestWorldScene`
  - ✅ create files
  - ✅ get infinite grid working
  - ✅ add geomorph canvases

- ✅ avoid blending THREE.AdditiveBlend geomorph PNGs i.e. depthWrite false only

- ✅ fix HMR full-refresh onchange `layout.js`

- ✅ recompute layout on `assets.meta[gmKey].lastModified` change
  - ✅ compute `assets.meta[gmKey].lastModified`

- ✅ websocket connection reconnects on close/open laptop

- assume `demo-map-1` always available as fallback
  - ✅ `api.map` should only be null before assets-meta.json loaded
  - document it somewhere

- ✅ avoid recomputing unchanged symbols via content hash

- ✅ show hull 3d walls
  - ✅ TestGeomorphs can see `api.scene` in TestCanvasContext
  - ✅ remove `transform` from `Geomorph.Layout`
  - ✅ precompute symbols "floor"
    - hull defaults to union of hullWalls sans holes, insetted
    - non-hull likewise, with fallback `(0, 0, width, height)`
  - ✅ render floor polys in `TestScene`
    - ✅ use canvas texture
    - ❌ canvas -> image -> texture
    - ✅ move debug.image into canvas
    - ✅ hull symbol floor polys 
    - ✅ non-hull symbols scaled down to world coords in assets-meta.json
    - ✅ sub-symbol floor polys 
  - ✅ try draw hull doors on canvas
    - ✅ api.assets is deserialized
    - ✅ change hull doors back to original size

    - rect -> edge(s) inside "symbol floor"
    - path -> edge(s) inside "symbol floor"
  - ✅ show wallEdges
  - ✅ precompute layout wallSegs in hull symbol
  - ✅ instanced two-sided quads for one geomorph
    - need wallSegs local gm -> world coords
  - ✅ instanced two-sided quads for all geomorphs
- ✅ show sub-symbol 3d walls
- ✅ wall segs change on edit map
- ✅ compute layout wallSegs in browser
- ✅ restrict doors in browser too
  - ✅ avoid origWalls i.e. store missing wall in symbol
- ✅ fix degenerate wallSeg
- ❌ show sub-symbol chairs, beds
  - ❌ use floating XZ planes
  - ℹ️ try single raised floor-sized texture
- ✅ changing map should change walls

- ✅ support optional walls e.g. `wall optional n`
  - ✅ `walls` does not include optional one
  - ✅ can add in optional ones based on sub-symbols

- ✅ avoid dev-server crash on save symbol to static/assets
  ```sh
  [1]   Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/Users/Robert.Myers/coding/np
  [1]   c-cli/static/assets/symbol/301--hull.svg.crswap'
  ```
  - ✅ store and read from media/symbols instead
  - ✅ still save to static/assets/assets-meta.json (so can fetch)

- ✅ on computeLayoutInBrowser change then layout should reload
  - ✅ onchange `geomorphService.computeLayoutInBrowser` recompute assets-meta
  - ✅ hash computeLayoutInBrowser function and provide in assets-meta

- ✅ show doors
  - ✅ try four segs (flickers)
  - ✅ doors -> connectors?
    - connector.roomIds unknown until know `rooms` i.e. in browser

- ✅ clean connector computation
  - ✅ apply transform to connector
  - ✅ cleanup "sign of polygon" issue
  - ✅ ParsedSymbol -> ParsedSymbolGeneric

- ✅ compute navPoly per geomorph
  - ✅ transform connector rects in browser
  - ✅ maybe only provide doors/windows as polys in assets-meta
  - ✅ optional walls are present by default
  - ✅ browser computes `rooms` and `doors`
    - test draw room outlines
  - ✅ try precompute doors/rooms

- ✅ move layout computation to geomorphs.json generated by assets-meta
  - ✅ connector: `Geom.ConnectorRect` -> `Connector` class (geomorph.js)
  - ✅ types Geomorph.Geomorphs, Geomorph.GeomorphsJson
  - ✅ assets-meta.js creates geomorphs.json
  - ✅ compute Geomorph.Layout server-side
  - ✅ connect geomorphs.json to browser
  - ✅ wallsSegs, doorSegs derived from layout
  - ✅ symbol.uncutWalls -> symbol.walls

- ✅ geomorphs.json has navPolys

- ✅ fix auto-update
- ✅ fix navPoly
- ✅ navPoly should include hull doorways
- ✅ uncut walls inherit meta
- ✅ rooms have meta via tag `decor meta`

## Scratch Pad

```jsx
// Why does this seemingly block main thread?
React.useEffect(() => {
  // 🚧
  import("recast-navigation").then(({ init }) =>
    init().then(() => {
      // compute vertices, indices
      let offset = 0;
      const vs = /** @type {number[]} */ ([]);
      const is = /** @type {number[]} */ ([]);
      state.gms.forEach(({ navPolys }) => {
        const { vertices, indices } = polysToAttribs(navPolys);
        vs.push(...vertices);
        is.push(...indices.map((x) => x + offset)); // 🚧 needs flip under conditions
        offset += vertices.length / 3;
      });
      is.reverse();

      import("recast-navigation/generators").then(({ generateSoloNavMesh }) => {
        const { navMesh, success } = generateSoloNavMesh(vs, is, {});
        console.log({ navMesh, success });
      });
    })
  );
}, [geomorphs]);
```
