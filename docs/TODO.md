# TODO

## Migration to Next.js (npc-cli-next)

- keep in sync e.g. glsl.js, Logger
  - `git diff --name-only "@{Sat 18 Sep}"`
- get Decor working

## WIP

- 🚧 ContextMenu rethink
  - ✅ move object-pick-circle into Debug
  - ✅ lastDown.{normal,quaternion} always defined
  - 🚧 `ContextMenus`
    - ✅ fix HMR by avoiding function-as-property
    - ✅ default i.e. via rmb/long-press
      - ℹ️ no popup
      - ✅ shows object-pick meta
      - ✅ positioned at click
      - ✅ object-pick meta collapsible (remembered)
      - ✅ scaled
    - ✅ can customise from CLI
      - ✅ links not icons
      - ✅ links trigger world events
    - ✅ can add static menu from default context menu
    - ✅ "save" creates static menu with left label `cm.key`
      - "save" and "pin" disappear
      - "exit" deletes
    - ✅ no need to refresh all i.e. use cm.epochMs
    - ✅ show-context-menu event
    - ❌ show-context-menu event
    - ✅ example of static panel
    - ✅ remove `ContextMenu`
    - ✅ default context menu can be "docked"
    - ✅ remove static panels
      - decided only default and speech bubbles
    - ✅ default context menu dock moves to lower left
    - ❌ default context menu can drag
    - ✅ extend default via script
      - ✅ can add/remove named "matchers"
        - ℹ️ w.cm.match.foo = bar
      - ✅ extra links on click switch
      - ✅ extra links on click door
        - do not support unauth npc inside room i.e. this action corresponds to having a remote key
      - ✅ links take effect e.g. open door
      - ✅ speech bubbles
        - ✅ can add for npc `w c.trackNpc rob`
          - cm.tracked as `w.n[npcKey]?.m.group`
        - ✅ can remove for npc `w c.delete @rob`
        - ✅ always scaled
          - seems hard-coded cm.baseScale better than "agent-to-camera-distance" when `w c.trackNpc rob`
        - ✅ improve styling
        - ❌ offset upwards
        - ✅ `w c.create rob`
        - ✅ can set speech
          - `w c.lookup.@rob.setSpeech 'foo bar baz'`
        - ✅ `w c.lookup.rob.say 'foo bar baz'`
        - ✅ `w c.say rob 'foo bar baz'`
        - ✅ can show links too
          ```sh
          w c.lookup.rob.setLinks "{ key: 'foo', label: 'foo' }" "{ key: 'bar', label: 'bar' }"
          ```
        - ✅ object pick npc shows bubble, not default context menu
        - ✅ can close bubble
    - ✅ default context menu on npc tracks npc
    - ✅ simplify speech bubbles
      - ✅ no links
      - ✅ `w.c.say {npcKey} {words}` ensures
      - ✅ `w.c.say {npcKey}` deletes
    - 🚧 links can be npc-sensitive
      - ✅ `cm.setNpc()` `cm.setNpc('rob')` and show
      - ✅ can remove by clicking it
      - ✅ temp: profile-1: triggered on select npc
      - ✅ triggered via long click npc
      - ✅ handleContextMenu accounts for `cm.npcKey`
      - 🚧 use custom select instead: choose none or npcKey 
      - clean up
  - ✅ remove icon generation code from asset.js
  - Logger also records speech and provides link options

- 🚧 try "off-mesh-connections" again
  - ℹ️ fix push-other-npc-thru-door via separation weight
  - ℹ️ fix lockers in bridge, fix diagonal doors
  - ✅ add off-mesh connections and visualise them
  - ✅ check separation weight cannot push agent into connection
  - ✅ nav.worker iterates through all off-mesh connections
  - ✅ nav.worker provides lookup from `{tile.minX},{tile.minZ}` to `{ offMeshPolysIds }`
  - ✅ detect off-mesh connection enter/exit
    - ✅ `enter-off-mesh`
    - ✅ detect when over (`agent.state() === 2`)
    - ✅ get off-mesh-connection
    - ✅ can detect src --> dst
    - ✅ `exit-off-mesh`
  - ✅ can pause agent by temp setting maxSpeed 0 on exit offMeshConnection,
    - `w n.rob.agent.updateParameters '{ maxSpeed: 0 }'`
    - `w n.rob.agent.updateParameters '{ maxSpeed: 2 }'`
  - ❌ can cancel just before traverse offMeshConnection?
    - ℹ️ once agent has changed state we can't stop it
    - ℹ️ https://github.com/isaac-mason/recast-navigation-js/discussions/458
    - ℹ️ taking new approach i.e. forking recastnavigation
    ```json
    "@recast-navigation/core": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__core@0.38.0",
    "@recast-navigation/generators": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__generators@0.38.0",
    "@recast-navigation/three": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__three@0.38.0",
    "@recast-navigation/wasm": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__wasm@0.38.0",
    ```
  - ✅ can see recastnavigation change on prod
  - ✅ use tsconfig.json to alias @recast-navigation/*
    ```js
    // 🔔 might need to `rm -rf .cache` and `yarn build` to see changes,
    //   at least when first switching to this approach
    "paths": {
        "@recast-navigation/core": ["../recast-navigation-js/packages/recast-navigation-core"],
        "@recast-navigation/generators": ["../recast-navigation-js/packages/recast-navigation-generators"],
        "@recast-navigation/three": ["../recast-navigation-js/packages/recast-navigation-three"],
        "@recast-navigation/wasm": ["../recast-navigation-js/packages/recast-navigation-wasm"]
    },
    ```
  - ✅ alter recastnavigation, so offMeshConnection are traversed more slowly
    - ℹ️ faster to directly alter recast-navigation-js/packages/recast-navigation-wasm/recastnavigation then move the changes to recastnavigation repo before commit
    - ✅ rebuild via `cd packages/recast-navigation-wasm && yarn build`
    - ✅ improve both segments of path
    - ✅ publish `@rob-myers/recast-navigation__wasm@0.38.1`:
      - at recast-navigation-js repo, manually change version/dep-versions (core,generators,three,wasm) in package.json to 0.38.1
      - then in repo root `yarn publish`
      - then in this repo `rm -rf .cache` `npm i` and `yarn dev`
  - ✅ bump versions in this repo and verify local build
  - ✅ can stop agent smoothly on enter-off-mesh
    - thanks to smoothening of off-mesh traversal and `crowd.raw.getAgentAnimation(agent.agentId)`
  - ✅ fix slight jerk when exit offMeshConnection
    - ✅ try specifying max velocity on leave
    - ✅ publish new version `0.38.2`
  - ✅ fix npc turn target for offMeshConnection
    - ✅ works smoothly
    - ✅ even smoother
      - ℹ️ agent.raw.get_cornerVerts(0..2) is "src" even after entered
      - ℹ️ "calcSmoothSteerDirection approach" does not seem to work
        - uses next two corners relative to current position
        - maybe it's making assumptions about how we steer
      - ✅ linear incoming bezier
    - ❌ could change final desired velocity in C++
    - ℹ️ straightness of offMeshConnection lacks smoothness of original approach, but has many advantages
    - ✅ clean
      - npc.s.offMesh.seg is `initial` or `main`
  - ✅ fix auto hull doors
    - ✅ not opening when traversing offMeshConnection
    - ✅ some npcs get stopped
  - ✅ door opens before going through offMeshConnection
  - 🚧 agent stops if door inaccessible on `enter-off-mesh` event
    - 🚧 temp set edge unwalkable
      - `w nav.navMesh.setPolyFlags 4341761 1`
    - temp stop any `enter-off-mesh` to this connection
  - in use off-mesh connection cannot be used by another
  - in use off-mesh connection with door open cannot be closed
    - without relying on "inside" sensor
    - remove "inside" sensor
  - ❌ could lerp whilst agent on off-mesh-connection
  - ❌ could remove agent from crowd and move linearly
  - ❌ navRectId --> connectedComponentId in gmGraph
    - fixed by computing navRectId using navPolyWithDoors
  - ❌ to avoid offMeshConnection backtracking could set `anim->startPoint` to be
    closest point on edge `startPoint -> endPoint`


- 🚧 pre next.js migration
  - ✅ finish/close wip todos
  - ✅ avoid stationary npc push through door
    - ✅ create a queryFilter with a doorway excluded and prevent a single agent from moving through it
    - ℹ️ `ch: 0.05` broke "door triangles"
    - ℹ️ `cs: 0.9` fixed bridge symbol disconnected component
    - ✅ npc.s.moving -> npc.s.target !== null
    - ✅ moved "stationary agents" should trigger sensor
    - ✅ on trigger nearby door, ensure excludeDoor queryFilter includes doors
    - ✅ maintain excludeDoors query filter where seen doorways are excluded
    - ✅ in case agent stops inside a door, prevent them from "moving aside" instead
  - ✅ avoid spinning targetless NPCs
    - collision could cause other to look but only at a "higher level of behaviour"

    - ✅ start options panel
      - ✅ has persist checkbox
      - ✅ auto-close if persist checkbox not ticked
        - ℹ️ see old `state.hide()`
      - ✅ can toggle mini view
      - ✅ SideNote "data root" should be World
      - ❌ can choose left/right/top/bottom to not block door?
        - ℹ️ too complex? e.g. doesn't
    - ✅ has small sphere indicating contact point
    - ✅ can track moving NPC?
      - ✅ `w n.rob.m.group | w --stdin cm.track`
      - ✅ `w cm.track`
      - auto track npcs

  - ✅ ContextMenu: customize @react-three/drei Html
    - ✅ create JavaScript projection
    - ✅ expose object3d
    - ✅ can force update
    - ✅ can CSS animate scale
  - ❌ ContextMenu: preserve open SideNote during HMR of Html3d
    - ℹ️ happens because we root.unmount() in useLayoutEffect
    - ℹ️ don't want to start caching roots per instance
  - ❌ ContextMenu simplify "key values"
    - ✅ switch decor have gdKey
    - ❌ picked value, grKey, gdKey, symbolKey
    - ❌ complex values optionally showable
  - ✅ object-pick provides normal
    - ✅ Walls material should be one-sided i.e. walls + lintels + windows
    - ✅ compute lastDown.normal
    - ✅ Decor quads
      - ❌ material should be one-sided (subtle e.g. need to flip document icons)
      - ✅ fix normal direction (flip) using camera direction
    - ✅ Decor cuboids
    - ✅ Doors should be two quads so get correct normal
  - ✅ ContextMenu use circle instead of sphere
  - ✅ fix 301 room 11 i.e. bridge room should be split in two
  - ✅ ContextMenu has select with possible actions
    - ✅ switches: can open doors
    - ✅ switches: can close doors
    - ✅ switches: can lock/unlock doors
    - ✅ switch `inner` but not `secure` can be opened by anyone
      - on leave room refresh ContextMenu
    - ✅ npc in room with locked door can still leave
    - ✅ BUG unlocked auto door
      - ℹ️ trigger auto doors in case they've been manually closed
    - ✅ BUG closed auto door
      - ℹ️ trigger auto doors in case they've been manually closed
    - ✅ ContextMenu strategy
      - ✅ hide when camera normal has +ve dot product with normal
      - ✅ list all npcs ever seen i.e. keep adding
      - ✅ show actions independently of npc distance
      - ✅ acts fail if npc too far
      - ✅ acts fail if npc in another room
      - ✅ if acts fail/succeed then coloured red/green
      - ❌ can open/close directly from door
        - cannot infer `meta.inner` unlike switches
      - ℹ️ for Player would probably hide ContextMenu on exit room/area (via sensor)
    - ✅ updateFromLastDown -> useHandleEvents
  - ✅ long press do point: actual nav mesh may be strictly smaller
    - ✅ from off-mesh closest point on nav mesh
    - ✅ still seeing long-press issues on mobile e.g. to bed from floor
  - ✅ meta.doPoint should be defined on all do points
  - ✅ World shows closable message until `awaitWorld` resolves
    - ℹ️ "connect a tty e.g. by clicking its tab then coming back"
  - ❌ fix stationary npc without access trapped next to closed door
    - no repro
  - ✅ can turn transparent walls on/off
  - ✅ ContextMenu: move "pin" inside pop-up
  - ✅ assets.js also converts icon--* directly to PNGs and WEBPs
  - ✅ ContextMenu: icons for open/close/lock/unlock
  - fire event onchange agent neighbours
    - ℹ️ could use it to reposition stationary npc (via process)
  - stationary npcs should rotate a bit when they move out of the way
    - ℹ️ use desiredVelocity to move ±5deg base direction
  - ✅ auto-open accessible door earlier
    - e.g. check up to two corners in this case
  - can only spawn onto navigable floor or do point
  - spawn onto do point uses orient
  - redo cuboid-man: lower-spine-bone (for sit), independent face quad, clean skin
  - redo cuboid-pet
  - represent skins as single TexArray
  - improve alternate character faces
  - improve alternate character icons
  - clean overwritten attributes using patched three.js:
    > `w.r3f.gl.getAttributes().remove(attribute)`
  - clean away off-mesh-connection if we don't use them

- 🚧 integrate Viewer into blog
  - 🚧 screenshots in 1st blog
    - ✅ screenshot data-url i.e. `w view.toDataURL`
    - ✅ open in browser i.e. `w view.openSnapshot`
    - ℹ️ our api only captures the canvas e.g. no ContextMenu, logger, Tabs, tty etc.
    - ℹ️ chrome devtool supports select node then >capture node screenshot
    - 🚧 1st image goes after explanation of "underlying problem"
  - blog has ui to mutate Viewer
    - can totally overwrite
    - can change World mapKey
    - can change tty env (e.g. PROFILE) and reboot
  - 🚧 clean up profile-1
    - e.g. `spawn rob $( click 1 ) --degrees=90`
    - e.g. `npc rob --showSelector=true --setLabel=Robbo`

### On hold

- npc stops on try nav to inaccessible-via-off-mesh-connection room
  - eventually?
- ✅ try align tiles with geomorph grid by extending navMesh slightly
- clarify/clean/simplify service/uv
- put into example-commands
  ```sh
  c=0
  while true; do
    w npc.spawn "{ npcKey: \"rob_${c}\", point: $( click 1 ) }" >/dev/null
    call 'x => x.home.c++'
  done
  ```
- sh: multi-line edit using Option+Enter not working
- remove stale examples from example-commands.md
- easier way to reboot control scripts
  - ℹ️ currently if edit `click` need to manually kill processes then run PROFILE
  - sh: can tag process e.g. as part of controls
  - sh: can kill processes based on tags
  - sub-script CONTROLS of PROFILE, which kills existing process and tags new ones
- better texture for cuboid
- prevent two different npcs from fading to same do point
- BUG saw e.npcToDoor missing key
  - ℹ️ maybe physics.worker broke on hmr
- Game Master option for partially transparent walls, where object-pick ignores walls
- useStateRef provides `state.ref(key)` which deletes sub-refs on null
  - maybe `useStateRef(() => state, { refs: ... })` to avoid re-creation
- ✅ profile-1.sh edit should not hmr Viewer
  - Viewer tabs def should not hmr Tabs
  - downgraded flexlayout-react
- ceiling shader lit according to camera angle
- can select npc while paused e.g. click npc causes single frame update?
  - ✅ via manually resumed process which controls selection
  - better way?
- npc should look ahead 2 segs and don't re-test
- Example of `state.crowd.raw.setObstacleAvoidanceParams(1, new Recast.dtObstacleAvoidanceParams())`?
  - recast-navigation-js discussion?
- hmr sometimes breaks npc opacity/selector
- skins: can remap "cuboid" head/body too
- ❌ try animate ceiling diffuse i.e. more/less white
- ✅ try avoid recreate decor/obstacles CanvasTexture by fixing texture size
- consider using rapier for raycasting, rather than adding three-mesh-bvh
  - try adding static non-colliding "walls and doors" and raycast against them
  - could filter out doors which are open
- decor hmr while paused broke decor quads instanceId?
- auto reduce fov when World canvas wide with short height?
  > `w update 'w => w.view.targetFov = 5'`
- ℹ️ to use `await ...` inside `map` we must write `async` in def (unlike `run`)
  - e.g. `echo foo | map 'async x => { await new Promise(r => r()); return x }'`
- ❌ Tabs: can specify initially awake background tabs e.g. tty for mobile
  - background tab never was rendered
- useGLTFsAsync hook
  - replaces synchronous useGLTF
  - supports multiple and provides each when ready
  - hmr: can provide hash (e.g. lastModified) triggering reload
- ongoing "large Chrome memory in tab" issue
  - ℹ️ https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6271282?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmac
  - ℹ️ `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --enable-logging --v=1 --verbose`
  - ℹ️ `cat '/Users/robmyers/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/chrome_debug.log'`
  - create a branch and repro without workers/crowd
- bug: tty: ctrl + w while multiple input: goes back a line
- bug: sh: paste multiline command and start Cmd-Deleting midway
- tty pause/resume should remember cursor position
- ✅ tty resize while multiline input still bit broken
  - resize small, then resize big and see broken line, resize bigger seems fixed
  - ℹ️ but native terminal has same issue
- ❌ change fov with camera distance? e.g. 15 far, 30 close
- decor labels should be instancedmesh with custom shader
- support click switch to open door, instead of click door
  - mobile has difficulty pressing switches, so
    try provide "echo circle" for touch devices
- stationary npc with agent uses navQuery with blocked doors?
  - to avoid being pushed through doors by other npcs
- ❌ hmr issue with Connector class
  - we don't support it
- ❌ hull door enter-room triggers late?
  - stale
- ContextMenu for door has button redirecting "lastDown" to nearby switch
  - easier for mobile users
- towards faster raycast against instancedmesh
  - https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh
  - https://github.com/pmndrs/drei/blob/master/src/core/Bvh.tsx
  - Walls has `useBvhRaycast` which constructs static geom and hijacks raycast
  - Doors has `useBvhRaycast` which constructs geom (doors closed) and hijacks raycast
    - will need "door open ratios"
  - 🤔 maybe use object-picking + canonical point instead
- doors can slide in specific direction
  - try scaling door and changing uv map
- maybe "move" constants into geomorphs.json
  - to avoid HMR versus geomorphs.json "alternate routes"
- workers should only hot reload when directly edited or geomorphs.json changes
  - workers should get constants from geomorphs.json
  - otherwise might restart early, retrieving old geomorphs.json
- ✅ can color obstacles
- request new nav-mesh onchange base "getTileCacheGeneratorConfig()"
- can choose colour of obstacle instances
- permit single quotes inside e.g. game-generators
- ❌ rebuild animation actions `IdleLeftLead`, `IdleRightLead`
- ❌ shoulder mesh (extend from chest), or arms closer to chest ❌
- decor sprite bounds issue on edit decor
  - e.g. resize extant decor sprite
- ✅ support recursive stringified Set
  - `expr 'new Set([new Set([0,0,1,1])])'`
- running `source PROFILE` twice breaks e.g. toggle door
  - maybe detect/warn "duplicate process def"
- duplicate walls in a symbol seemed to cancel each other out
- careful that world query doesn't "run twice at once"
  - e.g. by focusing window whilst ongoing?
- `Tabs` css should not reference src/const
  - try refactor `faderOverlayCss` e.g. merge into `<figure>`
- ❌ change camera fov based on camera height and/or visible-world
- Boxy rounding errors issue
  - https://boxy-svg.com/bugs/382/grouped-duplicate-then-snap-has-errors
- 🚧 memory leaks
  - ℹ️ use incognito to avoid extensions memory leak
    > https://superuser.com/questions/1843134/my-chrome-tab-memory-usage-increases-with-every-tab-reload-going-up-to-2gb-per-t
  - ℹ️ https://superuser.com/questions/1817473/what-accounts-for-the-discrepancy-between-the-memory-use-shown-when-hovering-on
  - ℹ️ can also use three.js stats UI which has a memory indicator
  - 🚧 interact, then take memory snapshot of both workers
  - geometry attributes are a possible memory leak
    - could update geometry attributes rather than create new attributes
      - see https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26835#issuecomment-1733180984
      - i.e. preset large bounds, and use geometry.setDrawRange
    - could use underlying gl api to remove attributes
WorldMenu log extras
  - permit resize (mobile too)
  - resize observer fits
  - checkboxes: pin ✅ show debug logs 🚧
- 🚧 Tabs: support keyboard shortcut to switch tabs: `ctrl+[`, `ctrl+]`
  - ✅ shortcut works in active tabset
  - ✅ clicking tab header sets active tabset
    - ℹ️ started working after npm upgrade
  - had to downgrade because profile edit remounts all tabs
    - https://github.com/caplin/FlexLayout/issues/456#issuecomment-2499190906

- could clean navMesh by
  - ℹ️ ongoing problem; we are "composing" recast-detour
  - adjusting geometry e.g. table in briefing room
  - adding custom areas
    - like existing door polys
    - tried "all room" already
- BUG obstacles.png slightly different onchange
  - no visible difference, probably due to "quick approach"
- verify HMR which propagates from assets -> geomorphs.json -> gmsData
- avoid connector re-computation i.e. extend serialization
- currently single quotes are breaking game-generators
- 🚧 Boxy SVG can be slow to save
  - https://boxy-svg.com/bugs/370/intermittent-slow-saving
  - 🚧 try replicate again in Chrome vs Incognito Chrome
  - 🚧 try turn off "FileVault" on Mac OS
- ✅ `w` command by itself should not throw
- syntax highlighting in the shell
  - https://github.com/wooorm/emphasize
  - for `declare -f foo`
  - for `PROFILE` via "hash-bang prefix"
  - for `/etc/game-generators.sh` via "hash-bang prefix"
- ignore certain tags e.g. `s`, `obsId`, `obstacleId`
- machinery less white
  - they have large white borders
  - try instance color

- prevent NPCs going through closed doors
  - i.e. color nav query
- ✅ use rapier physics 3d in web worker
  - i.e. static triggers

- next.js repo continued
  - migrate Viewer

- 🚧 more decor images
  - computer
  - speaker
  - communicator
  - fabricator
- place decor points on many tables
- more tables in 301
- more tables in 101
- verifyDecor inside CLI (previously did inside Decor)
- gatsby: somehow reconfigure `TerserPlugin` to exclude `npc-cli/sh/src/*`
  - already tried using extension `.min.js`
  ```js

- 🚧 🔥 sometimes during development restarting stops working,
  - can see 3d floor but console logs `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost`
  - observed that worker was not running
  - 🚧 try saving memory in web-worker, following recast-navigation-js
- TTY windows ctrl-c conflict: abort vs copy selection
  - take same approach as Windows itself
  - in Windows, when `this.xterm.hasSelection()`, ctrl-c should copy, not abort
- try leaving one logged-in window open before go offline, see how long it works
  > https://boxy-svg.com/questions/283/ability-to-use-while-offline
- distinguish symbols:
  - some extend beyond viewbox (e.g. stateroom),
  - some do not (e.g. table)
- ❌ static obstacles can specify color or shade
- tag `hull-wall` -> `wall hull`

## Scratch Pad

### Terminology

The system involves three parties:
- the _Player_.
- the _Game Master_ (GM).
- the _Environment_ (Env).

The Player is human.
The GM is either human or a computer program.
The Env is the underlying computer program where games are played/created by the Player/GM.

- ✅ Can Esc/Enter to enable/disable in Terminal/Tabs
- ✅ Terminal rendered using WebGL
  - fix HMR via `npm i xterm-addon-webgl` https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/4757

- ✅ abstract `TestWorld` as `TestCanvas`

  - ✅ `TestCanvas` has prop `sceneProps` to be used as `<Scene {...sceneProps} />`
  - ✅ create test scene `TestCharacter` and hook up to `Viewer`

- ✅ Fix remount issue
  - `TestScene` was exporting `customQuadGeometry` which broke HMR

  - ✅ `TestWorld` -> `TestWorldScene` in `TestCanvas`
  - ✅ remove `TestWorld`
  - ❌ start map-level UI with `HTMLSelectElement`s
  - ✅ THREE gridHelper -> single quad infiniteGridHelper
    - fix jsx type
  - ❌ can detect click geomorphs or hull doors

- ✅ `TestCanvas` has div ContextMenu shown on LongPress or RMB
    - ✅ when click outside scene
    - ✅ when click on floor in TestScene

- ✅ Don't use a web worker, here's why:
  - `<NPC>` should use react-three-fiber
  - But then js representation `state` inaccessible from main thread
  - TTY code runs in main thread, so would need another rep + communication
  - More generally would have to wrap THREE in a communication API.
  - We can return to "web worker approach" once the project is more mature

- ✅ can layout map using SVG with geomorph placeholders (rects)
  - ✅ create example layout svg
  - ✅ `symbols-meta.json` -> `assets-meta.json`
  - ✅ parse maps and store in `assets-meta.json`

    - was referencing stale prop
  - ✅ `TestScene` reads from JSON and updates onchange
    - requires window refocus
  - ✅ avoid window refocus
    - ✅ can extend gatsby with dev-only endpoints
    - ❌ endpoint `GET /dev-events` (for EventSource) and `POST /dev-files-changed`
    - ✅ create websocket server and test browser connect
      ```js
      const url = "ws://localhost:8012/echo"
      const wsClient = new WebSocket(url)
      wsClient.onmessage = e => console.log('message', e)
      wsClient.send(JSON.stringify({ yo: 'dawg' }))
      ```
    - ✅ can trigger websocket via curl
      ```sh
      curl -XPOST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        localhost:8012/send-dev-event \
        --data '{ "hello": "world!" }'
      ```
    - ✅ script assets-meta triggers websocket (if it exists)
    - ✅ browser triggers react-query refetch

- ✅ hull symbols have folder `symbols`, using placeholders
  - ℹ️ placeholders are partially transparent boxes of symbol filename's dimension
  - ✅ add stateroom symbol
  - ✅ extract during `yarn assets-meta`
  - ✅ maps: represent geomorph as single rect (via pattern)
  - ✅ clarify conversion { rect, transform } -> transform
  - ✅ compute affine transform we could apply to rect [0, 0, width, height]
    - ℹ️ want to eliminate rect.x, rect.y and transform-origin
      - let t_M be top-left of rect transformed under affine transform M
      - let t_S be top-left of [0, 0, rect.width, rect.height] transformed under 2x2 submatrix S of M
      - new affine transform is S plus translation (-t_{S,x} + t_{M,x}, -t_{S,y} + t_{M,y})

- ✅ maps parsing should support transform-origin too
  - ℹ️ can arise if rect starts with x, y attribs

- ✅ fix degenerate wallSeg
- ❌ show sub-symbol chairs, beds
  - ❌ use floating XZ planes
  - ℹ️ try single raised floor-sized texture
- ✅ changing map should change walls

- ✅ support optional walls e.g. `wall optional n`
  - ✅ `walls` does not include optional one
  - ✅ can add in optional ones based on sub-symbols

- ✅ avoid dev-server crash on save symbol to static/assets
  ```sh
  [1]   Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/Users/Robert.Myers/coding/np
  [1]   c-cli/static/assets/symbol/301--hull.svg.crswap'
  ```
  - ✅ store and read from media/symbols instead
  - ✅ still save to static/assets/assets-meta.json (so can fetch)

  - ✅ why does meshBasicMaterial order things correctly, but not my custom shader?
    > It's the shader material you're using. Three materials have routines build in that handle instanced meshes, the instancing is done in shaders
    > You can piece a working shader together from 'shaderchunks', or modify an existing shader with material.onbeforecompile

    - ✅ retrieve polygon points (messy)
    - ✅ get filter working
    - ℹ️ first attempt probably failed because we didn't "get enough" polygons?
    - ✅ navMesh has polys roughly corresponding to doors
    - ✅ can indicate found poly
      - packages/recast-navigation-core/src/nav-mesh.ts
      - seems we need exactly what's in `getDebugNavMesh` i.e. extra triangles inside poly is exactly so-called detailed-mesh (?)
    - ✅ cleanup
  - ✅ can re-plan moving agent path on HMR edit

  - ❌ TestCharacter:

- ✅ understand number of verts in mesh i.e. 278 is too many
  - ℹ️ 96 vertices in Blender:
    > `96 = 8 + (8*2*4) + 6*4`
    > i.e. head + (2 * arms + 2 * legs) + body
  - extras come from UVs i.e. need to duplicate vertex if has different UV
  - ✅ reduce to 241
  - ✅ reduce to 236
  - can probably reduce vertices more by re-arranging UVs, but:
    triangle count (168) and bone count (13) are probably dominating factor

  - ✅ obstacles has onPointer{Down,Up}
    - will decode actual obstacle hit later

- ✅ more raised obstacles
  - ℹ️ raising to wall height can cause flicker
  - ✅ 301

    - ✅ non-hull door width `220/5 * worldScale` i.e. `1.1m`
      - `220 x 400 sgu`
  - ✅ basic wall image
  - ✅ `assets.js` generates sprite-sheet json
  - ✅ `assets.js` generates sprite-sheet png/webp
  - ✅ `assets.js` sprite-sheet generation is `changedFiles` sensitive
    - skip other steps if only changedFiles are in media/decor
  - ❌ combine "create sheet and draw" into single function (decor/obstacle)
    - functions are quite complex, so keep them separate
  - ✅ avoid drawing sheets if nothing changed
  - ✅ avoid parsing maps if nothing changed
  - ✅ doors use uv map (hard-coded)
  - ❌ walls have uvs all pointing to basic wall image

  - ✅ use gmDoorKey format `g{gmId}d{doorId}`

- ✅ implement `click`
- ✅ test `click`
  - ✅ fix false positive

    map '({meta},{home}) => { home.selectedNpcKey = meta.npcKey }'
  ```
- ✅ "NPC click to move" should be a script
  ```sh

- ✅ can detect/ignore rmb in `click`
  - ❌ forward `rmb` from event
  - ✅ `click --left` (only left, default) `click --right` (only right)
- ✅ click sees modifier key(s) so `walkTest` can run

- ✅ start new branch `use-decor`
- ✅ currently, async generator -> `run`, but what about async function -> `map`?
- ✅ consider naming: shell `api` vs world-level `api`
  - now using `w` for both World api and command

- ✅ clean pointer-events i.e. avoid code duplication

      - detect `z` and auto project to `(x, z)`
  - ✅ create gm-room-graph, with breathing space


- ✅ fix HMR for gms-data
  - ℹ️ a bit wasteful e.g. recomputing `w.gmsData` on HMR,
    i.e. could check whether `createGmsData` function has changed.

- ✅ synchronise data changes
  - ℹ️ i.e. geomorphs, mapKey, gms, gmsData, gmGraph, gmRoomGraph
  - ✅ verify HMR still working
    - ✅ map change
    - ✅ symbol change
    - ✅ gmsData change
      - needed to `await import('create-gms-data')` to get it working

- ✅ obstacles have `meta.roomId`
  - ✅ gm.obstacles[i].center
- ✅ initial decor has `meta.roomId`
  - ✅ gm.decor[i].meta

- ✅ decor `rect` -> decor `poly`
  - avoid angled rects for decor (only for Connector)
- ✅ decor.key -> decor.id (string)
  - avoid confusion with `decorKey`
- ✅ decorKey -> decorImgKey
- ✅ decor.id -> decor.key


- ✅ Decor component
  - ✅ `<Decor>` exists
  - ✅ clarify identifiers
    - decorImgKey points into decor sprite-sheet
    - decorKey (string) identifies instance
    - can remove prev via "grouping by gmId" etc.
    - decorKey not same as numeric instanceId (from instanced mesh)
  - ✅ migrate decor grid
  - ✅ decor points have fixed dimension bounds2d
    - maybe should depend on whether they have an associated icon i.e. decorKey
  - ✅ can specify decor `cuboid` in symbols
  - ✅ can see decor cuboids in World
    - ✅ `gms[gmId].decor` induces initial decor
    - ✅ can add cuboid to instancedmesh
    - ✅ can remove cuboid from instancedmesh
      - `w decor.removeDecor g0dec4`
  - ✅ cuboid shader with vertex-normal lighting?
    - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderChunk
    - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/meshphong.glsl.js
    - ✅ try `diffuse * normal`
    - ✅ get "view aligned normals lightest" working

      - 100x100
    - ✅ `point` can have meta.img in `DecorImgKey`

      - when rotated rect 4-gon
  - ✅ decor points induce quads
  - ✅ all decor points _temp_ show decor info icon
  - ✅ fix HMR on change decor
    - world query was broken (wrong initial key)
    - also, now trigger Decor useEffect using query.status === 'success'
  - ✅ cuboid decor changes height with symbols e.g. d.center.y equals d.meta.y
  - ✅ `gm.decor[i]` has keys like instantiated
  - ✅ fix cuboid instantiation when angle non-zero
  - ✅ track instantiated decor new/changed/removed
    - track per-geomorph only (not per decor)
  - ✅ efficient decor re-instantiation
    - e.g. if map stays same and decor too, won't redo
  - ❌ try absorb Decor query into root query (avoid partial)
    - ℹ️ even if we merge into root query, have to mutate
      `w.decor` over time because `decorGrid` is too large,
      so cannot "apply changes synchronously"
  - ✅ prefer to apply root changes first
  - ✅ ensure decor of removed geomorphs is also removed
    - currently works when gmId ≤ next max gmId
  - ✅ world is not ready until decor ready
  - ✅ world can become "unready" onchange e.g. map, hmr
    - i.e. `w.isReady()` false when `w.decor.queryStatus` not success
  - ❌ wrap world in proxy, guarding by readiness
    - any invocation first await readiness
    - ℹ️ instead, expose API to permit higher-level approach
  - ✅ better decor point heights
  - ✅ move `w.setReady` into useHandleEvents
  - ✅ remove temp "all decor points shown with info icon"
    - ✅ can see labels (InstancedMesh) using decor.labelTex
    - ✅ permit spaces in labels via `label='foo bar'`
    - ✅ move labels from `gm.decors` into `gm.labels`
      - they won't be added to e.g. `w.decor.byKey`
    - ✅ ensure label UVs are updated
    - ✅ move w.labels -> w.decor.label
    - ✅ high-res labels
    - ✅ hide labels by default, show via `w update 'w => w.decor.showLabels = true'`
    - ✅ only show do/button points
  - ✅ rotate decor points according to `orient`
  - ✅ document on desk decor poly
    - ✅ document sprite (`icon--002--doc`)
    - ✅ add a `decor poly` with `img=icon--002--doc`
    - ✅ w.quads includes `decor poly`s
    - ✅ rotated rect 4-gon -> affine transform
      - need to know orientation of image
      - use "decor quad symbol" with axes pattern and dim 10x10
  - ✅ decor point induces quads
    - with fallback image `icon--001--info`
  - ✅ decor quad has fallback image
  - ✅ fix hmr on extend decor sprite-sheet
  - ✅ saw decor disappear when editing symbols
    - hopefully fixed by prevent query re-compute i.e. `retry: false`
  - ✅ fix decor point orient again (in transformed geomorph)
    - d.meta.orient -> d.orient for DecorPoint
  - ✅ decor cuboids can effect nav-mesh via tag `nav`
  - ✅ fix geomorph decor warns e.g. not fuel label not in any room
    - these were all labels, so fixed by moving them out of `w.decor.byKey`

    - ✅ use InstancedMesh color attribute and forward to custom shader
    - ✅ forward `meta.color` to cuboid
  - ✅ can choose colour of decor quads

- ✅ world provides "resolve when ready" api
- ✅ DecorQuad (not DecorPoly) derived from decor `<use>`
  - ✅ infer transform from 1x1 symbol
  - ✅ symbol instances apply to transform
  - ✅ use transform to position InstancedMesh instance
  - ✅ handle transform-origin


- ✅ fix sprite-sheet HMR
  - ℹ️ on add new symbol with obstacles
  - ℹ️ could fix with `yarn clean-assets && yarn assets-fast --all` + refresh
  - ℹ️ definitely data e.g.`geomorphs.json` or sprite-sheet, not program
  - ✅ could be problem with smart-sprite-sheet-update
  - ❌ could relate to adding symbol key to geomorph.js before we're ready?
  - ✅ visualise symbols graph i.e. media/graph/symbols-graph.dot
  - ❌ try repro with single geomorph
  - try fixing sprite-sheet size at 4096 x 4096 and see if re-occurs
  - 🤔 multiple websockets open in single browser tab?
  - ✅ saw issue onchange extant symbol i.e. remove some obstacles, add one symbol
    - ℹ️ this seems wrong 👉 `changedObstacles: Set(0)`
    - ✅ add `removedObstacles` and redraw sprite-sheet if non-empty
  - ✅ saw issue on WARN about mismatched size
    - `WARN medical-bed--006--1.6x3.6: extra--013--privacy-screen--1.5x0.2: unexpected symbol dimension`
  - ✅ saw out-of-sync, possibly Boxy SVG failed to save
  - ✅ saw issue on remove obstacle, then add back in
  - haven't seen any issues for a while, so closing

- ✅ remove `. ~/.bash_profile` from pre-push hook

- ✅ tty: `echo \'` should echo `'` (currently `\'`)
  - related to allowing single-quotes inside js (replace `'` -> `'\''`)
  - tryParseBuffer receives `["echo \\'"]` (which seems correct)
  - ✅ try interpreting Lit differently
- ✅ `SideNote` should wait a bit before showing
- tty should not render `NaN` as `null`
- `say` reading from tty should not terminate early when send a command before utterance finished
- ✅ `foo | map Array.from` failed because `Array.from` takes optional 2nd arg `mapFunc`
  - `map` recognises such cases does NOT pass `ctxt` inside `map` as 2nd argument
- ✅ fix `click 1` i.e. `click | ...` should not fire
- ✅ verify HMR which propagates from geomorphs.json -> gmsData


- ✅ fuel symbol can use single rect for wall
- ✅ thicker door ceiling tops
- ✅ `hull-wall` tag -> `wall hull`
- ✅ hull walls have `meta.hull` `true`
  - 🔔 cannot union with non-hull walls, api.derived.wallCount increased: `2625` to `2813`
- ✅ ContextMenu should work with ceiling
  - approach similar to obstacles
- support camera move via terminal
- improve doors hard-coding in decor sprite-sheet
- ✅ split component WallsAndDoors
- ✅ split component Surfaces
  - Obstacles
  - Floor

- ❌ TTY can get out of sync when edit cmd.service, tty.shell?
- ✅ can somehow ctrl-c `seq 100000000` (100 million)
  - same problem with `range 100000000`
  - same problem with `Array.from({ length: 100000000 })` (underlying JavaScript)

  - ℹ️ gatsby does not support "webpack multi-compiler"
  - ✅ `useEffect` with worker.terminate suffices -- don't need react fast-refresh in worker
- ✅ changing props.mapKey should change map

- ✅ integer accuracy when parsing maps
  - Boxy has rounding errors e.g. when reflect
  - ℹ️ seems fixed after setting Boxy accuracy as maximum (attr + transform)
- ✅ fix case where `transform-box` is ~~`content-box`~~ or `fill-box`
  - https://boxy-svg.com/ideas/409/reset-transform-origin-points-svgz-export-option
  - ℹ️ seen in parseSymbol of hull symbol
  - ℹ️ fixed by updating sphere bounds
- ✅ smaller collapsed nav on mobile
- ✅ can press Escape/Enter to pause/unpause

- ✅ hull symbols should have same scale as non-hull symbols
  - ✅ resize-* 301 ✅ 302 ✅ 303 ✅ 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 103 ✅
  - ✅ careful about duplicating patterns i.e. only use `pattern-0`
  - ✅ replace files, whilst changing scaling i.e. always 1/5
  - ✅ issue with e.g. `<use width height transform="matrix(5, 0, 0, 5, x, y)">`
    - we used browser script (see `dev-info`) plus correctly manually
  - ✅ understand issue with obstacle sprite-sheet
    - 🔔🔔🔔 hull symbol image is scaled-up (unlike other symbols)
    - could add a scaled image, but might add to load time
- ❌ decor point bounds determined by original rect/poly

- ✅ start new branch `use-physics`
  - ✅ web worker with rapier
  - ✅ rapier has `stepWorld` function (untested)
  - ✅ rapier world has static colliders
    - request geomorphs.json and construct in worker
  - ✅ convert numeric ids into strings i.e. npcKey and gmDoorKey
  - ✅ rapier world has kinematic rigid bodies
    - ✅ spawn induces kinematic rigid body
    - ✅ remove npc removes kinematic rigid body
  - ✅ rapier world is stepped per-npcs-position update
    - don't bother trying to send "succinct array" (yet)
  - ✅ rapier triggers worker message on npc collide
  - ❌ could represent many doors as one rigid body e.g. per gm?
    - no need to try this
  - ✅ main thread sends numerical array(s)
    - ✅ do not detect agent vs agent collisions
      - seems already aren't being detected
    - ✅ method for assigning numerical ids to bodyKey/Meta
    - ✅ worker lookup restored on hmr
    - ❌ send array of npc uids which should go to sleep
      - rely on rapier to auto set bodies asleep
      - https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/rigid_bodies/#sleeping
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ doors open automatically when npc nearby
  - ✅ doors can be open/closed, locked/unlocked, manual/auto
  - ✅ doors can be sealed
  - ✅ track door -> nearby npcs
  - ✅ track npc -> door sensors e.g. for clean-up

    - can open them individually
    - sensors already work
  - ✅ don't auto close door when npcs still within sensor range
  - ✅ clarify auto doors
    - ✅ do not auto-close when not auto
    - ✅ do not auto-open when not auto
  - ❌ manual doors are "blocked" inside nav query
    - we'll add physical switches for all doors, usable for manual
  - ✅ move worker handlers into WorldWorker
    - want handler edit to restart workers
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ tty: support recursive stringify of `Set` and `Map`
  - ✅ in tty.xterm output
  - ✅ `declare -x`
  - ✅ in shell expansion
  - ✅ separated shell function `pretty` into `pretty` and `json`
    - `pretty` is essentially `javascriptStringify` with indent 2
    - `json` is essentially `prettyCompact` and projects to JSON
      - e.g. does not support `Set`

- ✅ shell session: support restore Set and Map
  - ✅ serialize via `jsStringify` then re-evaluate
  - ✅ persist session on reset/unload
  - ✅ do not persist variable on run command (only on unload)

- ✅ service/npc -> service/helper
  - ℹ️ available runtime as w.lib.*

- ✅ can pipe `w.events` into shell
  - ✅ define `events` in game-generators.js
  - ✅ better error messages on mvdan parse error

- ✅ fix restart while `events | map key`
  - ℹ️ pipe child terminated late, triggering pid 0 cleanups, cancelling next awaitWorld
  - ℹ️ due to pipe semantics i.e. 30ms delay "to permit child cleanup setup"
  - ℹ️ need some delay (setTimeout `0`) e.g. for `take 3 | true` to terminate immediately
  - seems to be fixed, but somewhat hacky

- ✅ start new branch `refine-doors`

- ✅ decor cuboid shader: flipped cuboid has wrong normal/colour
  - ✅ use decor-quad symbol instead (neater)
    - didn't fix problem though
  - ℹ️ no, normals are fine
    - issue also happens when we simply translate stateroom 036

    - ✅ `inner` optional; `y=1 tilt img=icon--square` implied
    - ✅ `switch` localDoorId -> doorId on instantiation
      - ✅ remove switches when "parent door" is identified
      - ✅ for identified doors, assume both switches are `inner`
      - ✅ remove switches when "parent door" is removed

- ✅ LOD: when zoomed out a lot try making ceiling tops more solid
  - ✅ when far: fill but no stroke
  - ✅ when far: improve "large monochrome areas" e.g. lifeboat
    - tag svg symbols with `broad`
  - ✅ clean + fix HMR
    - seems MapControls onChange prop already supports hmr
  
- ✅ fix npc `way-point` event
  - ✅ event extends { ...current, next }
  - ✅ fires at final waypoint
  - ✅ doors have small wall above them
  - ✅ wall meta should have roomId
    - increase resolution of hitTest canvas
  - ✅ try extending `Walls` with two quads per door
    - i.e. two degenerate "one-segment-walls"
  - ✅ clean
  - ✅ locked indicator could go in center
    - ✅ render them inside `Doors`
    - ✅ green unlocked, red locked
    - ✅ setup initially locked doors
      - 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 103 ✅ 301 ✅ 302 ✅ 303 ✅
    - ✅ preserve locked flag via "door lookup by center"

- ✅ doors are specified as `auto`
  - ✅ temporarily set all doors `auto` 
  - 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 103 ✅ 301 ✅ 302 ✅ 303 ✅
  - ✅ unsealed hull doors implicitly `auto`
  - ✅ unsealed non-hull locked doors default to auto
    - we're setting "public" unlocked doors as auto
    - but e.g. unlocked fresher door inside locked room is not auto
  - ✅ implement "force-open" navigation while we implement navQuery
    - ✅ move door/npc logic outside Doors
    - ✅ move toggleDoor/toggleLock into w.s (shared)
    - ✅ w.s.toggle{Door,Lock} -> w.s.toggle
    - ℹ️ force-opening is distinct from having a key
    - ❌ toggle door opts.force
      - can already set opts.access undefined
    - ✅ npc.strategy 'default' or 'forced'
    - ✅ temp npc.strategy default to 'forced'
  - ✅ fix lock indicator for hull doors
  - ✅ w.s -> w.es
  - ✅ simplify w.es.toggle e.g. expects gdKey
  - ✅ w.es.toggle -> w.es.toggleDoor, w.es.toggleLock

- ✅ physics body keys `npc {npcKey}`, `nearby {gdKey}`
- ✅ physics body keys `inside {gdKey}`

- ✅ BUG onchange mapKey in Viewer
  - ℹ️ w.gmsData was being disposed before it could be used
  - ✅ physics.worker cannot read `world`
  - ✅ Walls/Doors not visible

- ✅ hash refactor
  - ✅ support w.hash[gmKey] and clean up
  - ✅ w.hash[gmKey].{full,nav,decor}
  - ✅ avoid recompute hash.images
  - ✅ can remove hash.images
    - sheets now contains imagesHash
  - ✅ move hash computations to browser
  - ✅ remove w.decor.computeHash
    - w.decor.hash points to last seen w.hash
  - ✅ use gmKey nav hash to avoid clearing npcToRoom
    - ✅ WorldWorkers has state.hash so can compare
    - ✅ send changed gmKeys
  - ℹ️ maybe can improve via murmur, but wait for timings via notifications

- ✅ import icons directly into Menu
  - rather than using `components/Icon`
- ✅ tty: avoid deleting paused line if user has typed something

- ✅ change way tabs are disabled/enabled
  - ✅ initially disabled tty shouldn't run profile
  - ✅ initially disabled World should be greyed out
  - ✅ while disabled, switching to an as-yet-unseen tab should mount it
    - believe this was already working

- ✅ tty: better disabled mount
  - we show message: "initially disabled"
- ✅ tty while disabled can ctrl-c sourced
  - tried sourced by adding `sleep 10` inside game-functions.sh
  - ✅ can pause/resume even when initially disabled
  - ✅ fix pause then resume while initially sourcing
  - ✅ cannot ctrl-c while initially paused
    - ℹ️ on hmr when paused (after resume) get blank tty, but works if resume tabs

- ✅ refactor Terminal without pause/resume
- ✅ refactor Terminal: add pause/resume
- ✅ on hmr `TerminalSession` unpaused tty should reboot
  - ✅ reset state.booted e.g. -> state.ts.booted
- understand error message on restart Tabs with running tty in background
- ✅ init paused:
  - ✅ tty should not run profile
  - ✅ runs profile on resume
  - ✅ cannot be ctrl-c'd
  - ✅ hmr `Terminal` preserves "single line shown"
  - ✅ hmr `TerminalSession` should render `Terminal`
  - ✅ can enter/esc while init paused

- ✅ fix hmr onchange tty.shell while paused (init or not)

- ✅ svg tag `switch={doorId}` -> `switch` and rely upon relative order to doors
  - we convert `meta.switch` into a number during parse

- ✅ can ctrl-c profile while tty paused (not init)
- ✅ fix: do not unpause on ctrl-c while paused
  - this means we cannot start initially paused via enter

- ❌ try merge TtyWithEtc into Tty
- ✅ TtyWithEtc -> TtyWithFunctions simplify forwards props.functionFiles

- ✅ can use terminal whilst paused
  - ✅ can start typing
  - ✅ can ctrl-c out of running process

- ✅ BUG ctrl-c of `echo 'foo\r\n`
  - wrong prompt shown after ctrl-c
- ✅ World pauses in background
  - e.g. try `w npc.npc.rob.moveTo '{x:-6.43,y:0,z:7.3}'`
  - could potentially permit "pause override" in future (e.g. pause one World, not other)
- ✅ BUG scrolling back through history of `echo 'foo\r\n\r\n'` loses a newline
  - happens when scroll back just beyond it

- ✅ Tty: resize-clear-input should also blur xterm

- ❌ pause tty ui issues
  - ℹ️ on switch tab, terminal pauses, and when come back, unclear whether should just continue
  - ℹ️ on continue using terminal when paused, enter can immediately launch unseen command
  - ❌ link choice instead: [ unpause ] or [ debug ]
  - ℹ️ decided on overlay instead

- ✅ World: "enable all" and "debug" overlay
- ✅ Tty: "enable all" and "debug" overlay
  - ✅ overlay fader and buttons
  - ✅ clean away other approach
  - ✅ avoid props.onKey from triggering resize

- ❌ "enable all" is highlighted when hover fader
  - instead, it is always highlighted whilst paused

- ✅ optionally permit camera movement while World paused 
  - ✅ pause/play toggle in viewer controls
  - ✅ remove fader from Tabs
  - ✅ add fader to World
  - ✅ can initially enable via click anywhere
  - ✅ on disable World fades by default; click anywhere to unpause
  - ✅ World has camera icon
  - ✅ can move camera when clicked

- ✅ fire event when npc enters/exits a room
  - ✅ sensor in each doorway, triggered on leave
    e.g. `inside g1d3` vs `nearby g1d3`
  - ✅ update npcToRoom
  - ✅ fix entered-room triggering
    - ℹ️ seen "npc position" not in room when running through hull door
    - possibly exasperated by collider near g0d0?
  - ✅ enter-room ✅ exit-room ✅ enter-doorway ✅ exit-doorway ✅ enter-sensor ✅ exit-sensor ✅
  - ✅ on reload nav.worker, recompute w.es.npcToRoom
    - ❌ clear lookup, except for unchanged gmKeys
    - ❌ lazily compute e.g. `w.es.getNpcRoom('rob')`
    - ℹ️ expect dev to handle this e.g. be in debug mode World/Tty
    - ✅ recompute over time; if not in room set undefined and warn
    - ✅ witness re-computation, and npc outside all rooms
  - ✅ roomToNpcs[gmId][roomId] i.e. inverse of npcToRoom

- ✅ xterm.js selection bug with gold text
  - needed to upgrade to `@xterm/xterm`
- ✅ hmr: support gm-graph
  - can ignore gm-room-graph because shouldn't really change,
    i.e. any "related" methods should inside gm-graph instead
- ✅ hmr issue editing obstacle outline
  - seems fixed by always re-generating obstacle texture, irrespective of size change

- ✅ on reload physics.worker, clear w.es.{npc,door}ToNearby
- ❌ `nav-changed` event for code supporting level-editing
  - ℹ️ dev should pause World while editing nav
  - ℹ️ in 2-player, changing levels shouldn't depend on this event

- ❌ npc move strategy dictates different navQuery
  - ❌ `anywhere`: no restriction (except sealed)
    - ✅ only open non-auto if (a) about to go through, or (b) would intersect
    - ❌ fix case where already nearby then move into/thru doorway
  - ❌ `adjacent`: can only nav to adjacent rooms
    - ❌ prevent nav through locked/closed-non-auto doors via "enter inside"
  - `accessible`:
    - block non-auto closed doors (including locked)
    - block locked auto doors

- ✅ refactor `npc.s.permitNav` i.e. support only one "move strategy"
- ℹ️ "all access" (e.g. `/./`) replaces `anywhere`
- ✅ refactor access keys as regexs
- ✅ remove `npc.s.permitNav`
- ✅ w.e.moveNpc(npcKey, point)
- ✅ assuming all access
  - ✅ fix move into doorway when already nearby
  - ✅ fix move through doorway when already nearby
- ✅ npc move should also work when lack access to door
- ✅ no-access npc should not stop when going through auto door
- ✅ can avoid checking each corner if no intersect and further away
- ℹ️ no-access npc stops early when onEnterSensor
- ✅ clean

- ✅ locked doors should close when
  - ✅ nothing `inside` and no `nearby` npc moving
  - ✅ trigger check when nearby npc stops (currently only on exit nearby sensor)

- ✅ fix bug: cannot close door when npc nearby

- ✅ BUG: tty: xterm paste (fails when line is single newline)
  - pasted newlines are normalized as `\r`: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1382#issuecomment-380309962
```sh
# repro
w gms | split | flatMap 'x => x.rooms' | map '({ center }, { w }, i) => {

}'
```
- ✅ BUG: tty: xterm paste then historical up (cursor in wrong place)
  - changed pasting behaviour i.e. previously we ran each line upon encountering newline,
    but now we just insert into to input
- ✅ BUG tty: xterm: cursor should skip over \r (now we normalize as \r\n)

- ✅ BUG: tty: xterm delete from end (moves one line down)
  - commented out "Right-edge detection" in `setInput`
```sh
# repros
echo 'foo {
}'
echo 'bar {

}'
```

- ✅ Support SVG symbol syntax `y=wallHeight`

- ✅ `take n` exits with non-zero code when doesn't take everything
  - so this terminates `{ echo foo; echo bar; } | while take 1 >tmp; do echo $tmp; done`
  - ✅ BUG `seq 5 | while take 1 >pos; do pos; done`
    - seems we cannot handle chunks using this method

- ❌ BUG tty: xterm: delete inside multiline command
  - repro didn't work
```sh
# repro by deleting from !")👈
call '() => {
  console.log("Wowsers!")
}'
```

- ✅ measure ~200 npcs FPS with current setup
  - ℹ️ 120 FPS with 177 without agent
  - ℹ️ 120 FPS with 177 with agent
```sh

- ✅ investigate GPU object picking via 2 render targets written to by 1 fragment shader
  - ℹ️ PR where render targets first added to three.js:
    > https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/16390
  - ℹ️ can provide vertex indices via attribute, hence instanceId too
    > e.g. https://discourse.threejs.org/t/how-do-i-get-the-vertex-data-from-my-position-attribute-into-a-shader-with-a-datatexture/52041
  - ℹ️ https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_interactive_cubes_gpu.html
  - ℹ️ Asked question https://discourse.threejs.org/t/is-gpu-object-picking-possible-with-a-single-render/70228
    - if we use a single shader with 2 outputs, seems we need a render target with 2 textures,
      and our "main scene" would be a full-screen quad, which breaks r3f pointer events
  - ℹ️ could re-use main scene as "picking scene" with different picking materials,
    - https://github.com/bzztbomb/three_js_gpu_picking/blob/main/src/gpupicker.js
    - need to extend approach to support instancedmesh e.g. via extra attribute
    - could avoid different shaders via boolean uniform

- ✅ towards gpu object picking: get walls working
  - ✅ Walls shader has own monochrome shader
  - ✅ Walls shader has boolean uniform `objectPicking` and behaves differently based on it
  - ✅ Walls shader has `gmId` attribute
  - ✅ Walls shader has `wallSegId` attribute
  - ✅ decode clicked pixel when shader turned on
  - ✅ fix hull wall z-fighting
    - ℹ️ object-picking issue (not visually where every wall black)
    - ❌ could omit/set-height-0 "outer overlapping walls"
      - too complex
    - ✅ manually inset outer hull walls slightly  
  - ✅ async read pixel
  - ✅ tidy: still running atm, will extend bit-by-bit
  - ℹ️ rgba is `(1, gmId, ((wallSegId >> 8) & 255)/255, (wallSegId & 255)/255)`

- ✅ add perf logging
  - ✅ assets.js timings
  - ✅ World has pin-able textarea
  - ✅ start writing logs from `World`

- ✅ fix "flipped decor" i.e. if decor quad transform determinant is negative,
  - flip the quad's uvs across "central vertical axis"

- ✅ can dynamically add to label sprite-sheet
  - ℹ️ `w update 'w => w.decor.showLabels = true'`
  - ✅ move `w.decor.label.quad` to `w.decor.labelQuad`
  - ✅ move `w.decor.{label,ensureLabelSheet}` to `w.label`
  - ❌ can incrementally extend
    - doesn't necessarily keep previous rects in same position
    - so, decor label uvs need to be recomputed
  - ✅ two label textures i.e. decor, npc (dynamic)
    - ✅ w.label -> w.decor.label
    - ✅ w.label -> w.npc.label
    - ✅ w.npc.updateLabels(["foo", "bar", "baz"])

- ✅ WorldMenu log should be a partially transparent xterm
  - ❌ use `BaseTty` but readonly
  - ✅ use vanilla `@xterm/xterm` Terminal i.e. `Logger`
  - ✅ clean up


- ✅ first draft of "hyper casual" characters
  - instead of pseudo minecraft character

      - width = depth = 200 (arbitrary units), height 230 (or 245 with top curve)
    - head: cylinder with 3 * 4 sides
      - width = depth = 200 (radius), height 125 (or 170 with curves)
  - ✅ 1st attempt at character
    - facing along negative Y
    - head: 12-side cylinder + bevel modifier
    - body: cuboid (x2 vert split, tapered towards head) + bevel modifier
    - needs shadow too
  - ℹ️ blender:
    - set pivot mode in top menu e.g. as 3d cursor
    - absolute positions: N to toggle
  - ℹ️ blender edit mode:
    - Cmd+R loop cut

    - ✅ auto update character skin
      - expose hash and `w.debug.char.setSkin(i)`
  - ✅ CameraLightMaterial should support texture map
  - ✅ `w.debug.testChar` --> `w.debug.char`

    - ✅ fix body uv-map
      - ✅ boxy SVG: sketch out more efficient uv-map (0.4 cuboid head, 0.4 * 1 * 1 body)
      - ℹ️ cannot avoid dup vertices: 8 + (3 * 16) = 60
        - https://stackoverflow.com/a/76713671/2917822
      - ✅ redo uv-map using above as guide
    - ✅ change vertex ordering: head < body < selector < shadow < label
      - ℹ️ head < body < selector < shadow < label
        - 60 vertices in total (after 3 * - for cuboid vertices)
        - `head` 3 * 8 [0, 23] < `body` 3 * 8 [24, 47] < `selector` 4 [48, 51] * < `shadow` 4 [52, 55] < `label` 4 [56, 59]

    - ✅ head < body < shadow < selector < label
    - ✅ body has icon
      - ℹ️ boxy: cmd+shift to scale uniformly to center 
      - ✅ center-front quad: head < body < shadow < selector < front-icon < label
    - ✅ can toggle selector/label

    - ✅ can change selector color
    - ✅ label higher so doesn't come through walls?
    - ✅ selector intersection problem
      - ✅ discard alpha < 0.1
      - ✅ higher, so drop shadow always beneath
  - ✅ control vertex ids in Blender
  - ❌ avoid 2 SVGs if possible i.e. uv-bg, tex
    - keep them separate e.g. can label "B-F" for body front
  - ✅ various different icons in character sprite-sheet
    - ℹ️ more in e.g. decor sprite-sheet

- ✅ bug: tty: `map 'x => 2 ** x'` then press delete

- ✅ support non-door sensor i.e. decor circle/rect
  - ✅ can manually add:
    ```sh
    w physics.worker.postMessage '{
      type: "add-colliders",
      colliders: [{
        type: "rect", width: 1.5, height: 1.5, x: 3, y: 7.5,
        colliderKey: "myTestCollider",

      type: "remove-colliders",
      colliders: [{ type: "rect", colliderKey: "myTestCollider"}],
    }'
    ```

    - ✅ can provide `userData` in "add-colliders"
    - ✅ event `{ key: "gm-decor", type: 'updated', gmId }`
    - ✅ event `{ key: "gm-decor", type: 'removed-all' }`
    - ✅ simplify events i.e. only send one:
      - `{ key: "updated-gm-decor", type: "partial", gmIds }`
      - `{ key: "updated-gm-decor", type: "all" }`
        - clean not necessary, because world recreated?
    - ✅ events forwarded to physics worker
    - ✅ onchange decor rect (add meta.collider)
      - ✅ decor queryKey changed
      - ✅ "updated-gm-decor" emitted
      - ✅ `w.hash.gmHashes` -> `w.hash.mapGmHashes`
      - ✅ fix `{key:"updated-gm-decor",type:"partial",gmIds:[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]}` when only 301 changed
    - ❌ physics worker receives message
      - ℹ️ sending too early i.e. worker is being reset?
    - ✅ on reset worker world physics includes gm-decor
      - ℹ️ no need to forward event `updated-gm-decor`
      - ℹ️ wasteful i.e. could partially rebuild physics
    - ❌ events trigger:
      - removal of previous physics bodies with userData.{instanced,gmId}
      - creation of physics bodies with userData.{instanced,gmId}
  - ✅ support angled rect
    - ✅ can specify in `add-colliders`
    - ✅ can handle angled gm-decor rect
  - ✅ simplify add-colliders message
    - ✅ `rect` or `circle` rather than `cuboid` or `cylinder`
    - ✅ reformat
  - ✅ can remove-colliders

    - upgraded to blender 4.2 (didn't fix)
    - removed other mesh/armature (didn't fix)
    - removed/added armature (seemed to work)
  - ✅ saw gltf export bug again
    - ℹ️ it was probably due to various "Fake User" animations from deleted armature/meshes
    - ✅ move root bone down to origin
    - ✅ added a keyframe to "Idle" (must do this)
  - ✅ `<mesh>` -> `<skinnedMesh>`
    - ✅ Idle animation is imported

    - ✅ support breathing via root bone scale
      - head_bone: Bone > Relations > Inherit Scale: `None`
    - ✅ create basic idle animation
    - ✅ works with `<meshPhysicalMaterial>`
    - ✅ works with our custom shader

      - ✅ encode existing uvs as DataTexture and read using vertex id
      - ✅ encode texture id too
      - ℹ️ no need for DataTexture
        - use uniforms for face/icon/label instead
        - `uniform int uLabelTexId` (which texture to use)
        - `uniform vec2 uLabelUv[4]` (4 for quad)
      - ✅ pre-compute ±0.5 uv coords for label quad

      - ✅ npc.startAnimation('Idle')
      - ✅ initializes position/angle of npc sans agent
      - ✅ on add agent pins it to current position

  - ✅ extra--020--table-2x0.66
  - ✅ add placeholder symbol to 303

- ✅ fix symbols in 303 i.e. definitions should have correct size

- ✅ uv-map for label seems wrong i.e. should cover 256 * 128
  - 🔔 seems npm module `canvas` does not support scaled text properly
    when `saveCanvasAsFile`, so change text size instead

- ✅ bug: permitted npc going thru closed door
  - ❌ `state.isUpcomingDoor(npc, door)` is false when should be true
  - ℹ️ 301 npc starts near closed door of office, click adjacent stateroom
    - even worse when another npc is in the way
  - ❌ try smaller nearby sensor 0.9 * x
  - ✅ fallback: open on trigger "inside" sensor
  - ✅ try cuboid "nearby" sensor
  - ℹ️ still happens i.e. door opens at last moment, but will suffice for the moment

- ✅ can debug physics colliders
  - ✅ connect `Debug` to physic.worker
  - ✅ refine userData type: `WW.PhysicsUserData`
  - ✅ can render `nearby` colliders in Debug
  - ✅ can render `inside` colliders in Debug

    w npc.npc.rob.setFace '{ uvMapKey: "cuboid-man", uvQuadKey: "front-face-angry" }'

    w geomorphs.sheet.skins.uvMap.cuboid-man.front-label-food
    w npc.npc.rob.setIcon null
    w npc.npc.rob.setIcon '{ uvMapKey: "cuboid-man", uvQuadKey: "front-label-food" }'
    ```

- ✅ sh: semantics: support e.g. `foo=$( w npc.npc.rob )`
  - ℹ️ we were "javascript stringifying" inside command substitution
  - ℹ️ now, command subst directly inside an assign forwards non-string value/values
  - e.g. `foo=$( seq 3 )`, `foo=$( w npc.npc.rob )`

- ✅ can run e.g. `w npc.npc.rob` inside pipeline.
  - i.e. use syntax `click 1 | w --stdin gmGraph.findRoomContaining`

- ✅ bug: sh: isolate bug involving nested pipelines terminating early, e.g.
  - ℹ️ still happens when we comment out `killPipeChildren`
  - ℹ️ thrown by preProcessWrite i.e. pipeline-between-whiles has finished reading
```sh
# 1st repro
click --long | filter meta.do | while take 1 >lastClick; do
  w npc.npc.rob | map '(npc, {home}) => npc.do(home.lastClick)'
done &

# 2nd repro
while true; do
  echo foo
done | while take 1; do
  # echo bar
  echo bar | echo baz
done
```

- ✅ implement "do points"
  - ℹ️ see repo the-last-redoubt src/projects/world-pixi/create-npc.js

  - ✅ async npc.fade
  - ✅ async npc.fadeSpawn
    - `w npc.npc.rob.fadeSpawn $( click 1 )`

  - ✅ async npc.do (migrate code)
  - ✅ can spawn to non-nav point
    - ✅ remove agent
    - ✅ restore agent on re-enter nav
  - ✅ restore Walk/Run animations
    - simplified to a single frame i.e. lean forwards

    - seems group.rotation.order `XYZ` rotates about y-axis ccw (x right, -z up)
  - ✅ npc.do can Sit (1st attempt)
  - ✅ npc.do can Lie (1st attempt)
    - use meta.y to raise off ground
  - ✅ fix cuboidManShader when `Lie`
    - ℹ️ not taking bone transforms into account
  - ✅ opacity/showSelector breaking?
    - ℹ️ e.g. ineffective: `w npc.npc.rob.fade 0.5`
    - maybe stale reference to shader?
  - ✅ can `do` via long press
    - ✅ useHandleEvents ignores long press of do point
    - ✅ clarify `click 1` returning nothing on e.g. RMB
      - ℹ️ `click 1` outputs nothing if you do a long click
      - ℹ️ `click --long 1` works instead
    - ✅ profile-1 has custom code
  - ✅ hide shadow for Lie, Sit via animation
  - ✅ one-frame animations: Sit, Lie
  - ✅ npc.startAnimationByMeta handles do meta
  - ✅ fix briefing table do point orients
  - ✅ more centred on do points
    - ✅ onclick do point provide `meta.doPoint` e.g. centre of icon
  - ✅ fix do points at head of briefing table
  - ❌ can specify do point offset e.g. further back for stool
  - ✅ fadeSpawn/spawn can specify agent
    - defaults true when spawn on nav
    - avoid setting doMeta.hadAgent
  - ✅ verify can set initial angle (ccw from east)
  - ✅ fix do point on particular seat on briefing room table
    - seems to think it is in navmesh e.g. small island?
  - ✅ improve shadow for other animations

- ✅ cleanup before merge branch
  - ✅ door click should not propagate to floor
    - ℹ️ `click` will only set `meta.nav` as `true` if `meta.floor`
  - ✅ nearby nav click should cause move to
  - ✅ merge npc.waitUntilStopped into useHandleEvents
  - ✅ reject.turn, reject.fade
  - ✅ npc.turn -> npc.look
  - ✅ cannot spawn to arbitrary off-mesh position from off-mesh do point

- ✅ sh: `map --forever` does not terminate on throw

- ✅ profile-1: long click floor makes npc look towards it
  - ℹ️ `get lastClick/meta/floor` has exit code `0` iff `lastClick.meta.floor` exists
  - ℹ️ `test foo` has exit code `0` iff evaluated JavaScript `foo` is truthy
    > e.g. `test $( w | map 'w => ...' )`
  - e.g. `test $( call '({ home }) => home.lastClick.meta.floor === true' )`
  - e.g. `test $( get lastClick/meta/floor )`
  - ✅ two approaches i.e. `while` or `map`

- ✅ `map` awaits when working with an async function
  - ℹ️ we still require "async" keyword to be manually provided
  - `seq 1000000 | map 'x => x + 1'` (fast)
  - `seq 100000 | map 'async x => x + 1'` (slow: many promises)

- ✅ migrate Floor and Ceiling to single draw-call
  - ℹ️ still need floor pointer events for navigation
  - ✅ positionInstances
  - ✅ specify textureId convention
    - ℹ️ by first seen respective gmKey
  - ✅ addUvs
  - ❌ coverage of MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS at 16 vs min 8?

      - ℹ️ won't fix because will be replaced by object-pick

- ✅ bug: `w npc.remove will` breaks door collision detection
  - must clear positions (surprising didn't have issue)


- ✅ bug: can navigate through locked door
  - ℹ️ improved by testing on each `way-point`
  - ℹ️ could test nextTargetInPath rather than all corners
  - ℹ️ nav mesh via filter is only partial solution due to "going stale during navigation"

- ✅ more efficient door collision testing
  - only check one-step ahead (next target, not corners)

- ✅ spawn near auto door triggers sensor
- ✅ spawn from near auto door triggers sensor

- ✅ physics colliders still aren't rotated correctly
  - ✅ compute and send lines from world.debugRender
  - ✅ draw lines from world.debugRender
  - ✅ fix alignment
  - ❌ fix colliders issue on refresh
    - no repro, might be hmr-related

- ✅ more nav through doorways issues
  - ℹ️ sometimes triggers much too late when "winding round corner of door"
  - ✅ nav seg was outside doorway, so door.doorway -> door.collidePoly,
    which is wider (full door width) yet shallow (slightly less than doorway)
- ✅ consider transparent body skin
  - transparency supported
- ✅ fix flickering hull door base (onchange camera view)
  - suffices to add a matching line

- ✅ instancedUvMappingShader (Doors, Obstacles, Decor quads/labels) -> instancedMultiTextureShader
  - ✅ bin packer supports multiple sheets
  - ✅ decor can have multiple images
    - ✅ static/assets/2d/decor.{sheetId}.png
    - ✅ World loads all into TexArray

  - ✅ test decor hmr for multiple sheets
  - ✅ test obstacle hmr for multiple sheets


- ✅ gpu object-pick
  - ℹ️ encode (glsl) e.g. gmId, instanceId -> (1, gmId, instanceId >> 8, instanceId)
  - ℹ️ decode (js)   e.g. (r, g, b, a) -> 'wall', gmId, instanceId
  - ✅ walls: glsl encode uses function
  - ✅ walls: js decode uses function
  - ✅ support transparent
  - ✅ handle npcs
    - ✅ npc click detected
    - ✅ npcs need integer uid
      - ℹ️ assume max npcs 256
      - ℹ️ maintain Set([0..255])
  - ✅ floor object-pick
    - must compute non-object-pick opacity
    - `(2, gmId, 0, gl_FragColor.a)`
  - ✅ ceiling object-pick
    - must compute non-object-pick opacity
    - `(3, gmId, 0, gl_FragColor.a)`
  - ✅ w.ceiling uses w.floor quad
  - ✅ doors object-pick
    - `(4, instancedId, 0, gl_FragColor.a)`
  - ✅ decor quad object-pick
    - `(5, quadInstanceId, 0, gl_FragColor.a)`
  - ✅ obstacle object-pick
  - ✅ decor cuboid object-pick
  - ✅ lock light object-pick
  - ✅ on pick floor, raycast against infinite floor plane
    - ℹ️ manual approach needed to avoid raycast large number of instanced meshes
  - ✅ send pointer events
    - ℹ️ must object-pick on "down" e.g. for long press
    - ℹ️ can avoid object-pick on "up" (if close to down then use it)
    - ✅ `click 1` should provide a 3d position
      - all object-pick types have a position
    - ✅ fix RMB click: state.pickObject can end after native "pointerup"
  - ✅ enrich event meta as before
    - WorldCanvas ✅ Floor ✅ Walls ✅ Doors ✅ Obstacles ✅ Ceiling ✅ Decor ✅ Npcs ✅ 
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ cached geometries should have `w.key` prefix
- ✅ clean before merge branch
  - ✅ avoid dup w.ui.rootState, w.r3f
  - ✅ w.ui -> w.view
  - ❌ try alt style
    - ✅ outlined labels
    - ❌ adjust npc lighting
  - ✅ careful about alpha=0 in object-pick encoding
    - ℹ️ e.g. 768 ~ 0 mod 256
    - ✅ fix instancedMonochromeShader

- ✅ support `await api.sleep(1)` inside `map`
  - ℹ️ e.g. `{ echo foo; echo bar; echo baz; } | map 'async (input, {api}) => { await api.sleep(1); return input }'`
  - ✅ simplify `choice` so it does not use `sleep`
  - ✅ refactor underlying `choice` as AsyncFunction 
  - ✅ refactor `sleep` as AsyncFunction
- ✅ avoid initial instanced mesh render
  - ✅ avoid overwriting attributes
  - still seeing issue on mobile, but only on reset
- ✅ understand ~~duplicated~~ coinciding npcs e.g. on edit recast-detour.js
  - ℹ️ seems npc `will` is coinciding with npc `rob`
  - ℹ️ saw happen when changed symbol chairs
  - seems fixed via improved `w.npc.restore()`
- ✅ fix initial shader errors
  - [.WebGL-0x11809663f00] GL_INVALID_OPERATION: Vertex shader input type does not match the type of the bound vertex attribute.
  - ℹ️ useLayoutEffect related
  - ✅ try fix Floor, Walls, Doors, Obstacles, Ceiling (might break initial flicker fix)
  - ✅ replace useLayoutEffect with "mount-shader-when-ready"
- ✅ clarify connected nav issues:
  - ℹ️ inaccessible door should not prevent nav through open door
  - ℹ️ `maxSimplificationError: 0.85` helped, but causes nav kinks, so removed
  - ℹ️ npc should not be able to get too close to inaccessible door

- ✅ pause/resume should not progress motion along navMesh
- ✅ can spawn whilst in debug mode
  - pointerup triggers since update/render

- ✅ Decor/Doors, Floor/Ceil: hmr issue i.e. disappears
  - ℹ️ not dispose
  - ✅ related to TexArray
  - maybe fixed for Decor/Doors (0 width canvas check)
  - maybe fixed for Floor/Ceil (0 width canvas check)

- ❌ try navMesh sans doorways using off-mesh connections instead
  - ✅ add off-mesh connections per non-hull doorway
  - ✅ detect when enter off-mesh connection
    - prevState !== agent.state() and one equals `2`
  - ❌ try using requestMoveVelocity (did not work)
  - ℹ️ unnatural navigation + non-trivial to change on-connection speed

- ✅ `click` is v3 and has `clicked.xz`?
  - ✅ profile-1 click consumers could be 2d/3d agnostic
  - `click 1 | w view.zoomTo --stdin`
  - ℹ️ example where 2d project needed: `click 1 | w gmGraph.findRoomContaining`,
    - could `click 1 | map xz | w gmGraph.findRoomContaining`
    - could `click 1 | map meta`
  - ℹ️ can use `w.lib.toXZ` and `w.lib.toV3`

- ✅ `w --stdin` e.g. `echo image/webp | w --stdin view.openSnapshot - 0` should be low quality
  - ℹ️ should be same as `w view.openSnapshot image/webp 0`
  - ℹ️ getopts is reordering hyphen `-` i.e. need another dummy symbol to represent stdin
  - use underscore `echo image/webp | w --stdin view.openSnapshot _ 0`

- ✅ change const.js hmr issue i.e. floor/ceiling disappears
  - ℹ️ floor comes back if remount material...
  - ℹ️ seems floor data texture `source.data` is all black
  - ✅ `w.texVs.{floor,ceiling}++` in world query
  - ✅ `w.tex{Floor,Ceil}`
  - ℹ️ should try to replace `w.update()`
- ✅ jerky npc movement when pause then unpause while moving
  - ℹ️ Floor/Ceiling were needlessly recomputed

- ❌ try scaling geometry up, using cs=0.15, then scaling down

- ✅ BUG saw npc stuck with: agent, s.act (Walk), s.target (non-null)
  - ℹ️ by running quickly many times
  - ℹ️ `w n.rob.agent.velocity` is `{x:0,y:0,z:0}`
  - ✅ seems to be issue with nav mesh (cs too small)

- ❌ try creating nav tiles to see if it avoids "steiner points"
  - ✅ migrate https://github.com/isaac-mason/sketches/blob/main/sketches/recast-navigation/dynamic-tiled-navmesh/src/navigation/dynamic-tiled-navmesh.ts
    - ✅ dynamic-nav-mesh ts -> js
    - ✅ build-tile ts -> js
    - ✅ move worker code into nav.worker
    - ✅ get demo build working
    - ✅ show demo navmesh
  - ❌ decided against it
- ✅ try improve nav by changing tile size
  - small tile size `0.1` has many Steiner points, yet is pretty good
- ❌ try avoid nav steiner points via large tile size and using areas
  - too "non-canonical"

- ✅ fix npc.setLabel
  - ✅ onchange label sprite-sheet, update *all* effected npc
  - ℹ️ could share uniforms via DataTexture
  - ℹ️ could avoid excessive computation by pre-building `rob_{1..200}`
