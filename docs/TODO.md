# TODO

## WIP

- 🚧 implement "do points"
  - ℹ️ see repo the-last-redoubt src/projects/world-pixi/create-npc.js
  - ✅ npc.fade (in or out)
    - `w npc.npc.rob.fade 0.2`
    - `w npc.npc.rob.fade 1`
  - ✅ async npc.fade
  - ✅ async npc.fadeSpawn
    - `w npc.npc.rob.fadeSpawn $( click 1 )`
  - ✅ async npc.turn
  - ✅ async npc.onMeshDo
    - ℹ️ for the moment use `startAnimation('Idle')`
  - ✅ turn faster whilst walking
  - ✅ refactor walk onStart callback
  - ✅ async npc.offMeshDo
  - ✅ async npc.do (migrate code)
  - ✅ can spawn to non-nav point
    - ✅ remove agent
    - ✅ restore agent on re-enter nav
  - npc.do fix orientation angle
  - npc.fadeSpawn can specify agent
    - defaults true when spawn on nav
  - clarify initial angle convention e.g. ccw from east
  - one-frame animations: Sit, Lie
  - onclick do point provide `meta.doPoint` e.g. centre of icon
  - npc.startAnimation handles do meta


- merge npc.waitUntilStopped into useHandleEvents
- does e.g. resolveTurn need a way to reject?

- 🚧 next.js project (npc-cli-next)
  - keep in sync e.g. glsl.js, Logger
    - `git diff --name-only "@{Sat 18 Sep}"`
  - get Decor working

- ✅ fix blurred curved table in 303
  - ✅ extra--020--table-2x0.66
  - ✅ add placeholder symbol to 303

- ✅ fix symbols in 303 i.e. definitions should have correct size


- ❌ Tabs: can specify initially awake background tabs e.g. tty for mobile
  - background tab never was rendered
- consider mobile helper UI which directs user to tty-1 and back...
- 🚧 Tabs: support keyboard shortcut to switch tabs: `ctrl+[`, `ctrl+]`
  - ✅ shortcut works in active tabset
  - clicking tab sets active tabset
- ongoing "large Chrome memory in tab" issue
  - ℹ️ https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6271282?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmac
  - ℹ️ `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --enable-logging --v=1 --verbose`
  - ℹ️ `cat '/Users/robmyers/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/chrome_debug.log'`
  - create a branch and repro without workers/crowd
- bug: tty: ctrl + w while multiple input: goes back a line
  - need repro
- improve alternate character faces
- improve alternate character icons
- change fov with camera distance? e.g. 15 far, 30 close
- support multiple skins for single test character
- decor labels should be instancedmesh with custom shader
- consider transparent body skin
- fix flickering hull door base (onchange camera view)
  - suffices to add a matching line
- support click switch to open door, instead of click door
  - mobile has difficulty pressing switches, so
    try provide "echo circle" for touch devices
- stationary npc with agent uses navQuery with blocked doors?
  - to avoid being pushed through doors by other npcs
- ❌ hmr issue with Connector class
  - we don't support it
- hull door enter-room triggers late?
- towards faster raycast against instancedmesh
  - https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh
  - https://github.com/pmndrs/drei/blob/master/src/core/Bvh.tsx
  - Walls has `useBvhRaycast` which constructs static geom and hijacks raycast
  - Doors has `useBvhRaycast` which constructs geom (doors closed) and hijacks raycast
    - will need "door open ratios"
  - 🤔 maybe use object-picking + canonical point instead
- doors can slide in specific direction
  - try scaling door and changing uv map
- maybe "move" constants into geomorphs.json
  - to avoid HMR versus geomorphs.json "alternate routes"
- workers should only hot reload when directly edited or geomorphs.json changes
  - workers should get constants from geomorphs.json
  - otherwise might restart early, retrieving old geomorphs.json
- ✅ can color obstacles
- request new nav-mesh onchange base "getTileCacheGeneratorConfig()"
- can choose colour of obstacle instances
- permit single quotes inside e.g. game-generators
- rebuild animation actions `IdleLeftLead`, `IdleRightLead`
- ❌ shoulder mesh (extend from chest), or arms closer to chest ❌
- decor sprite bounds issue on edit decor
  - e.g. resize extant decor sprite
- support recursive stringified Set
- running `source PROFILE` twice breaks e.g. toggle door
  - maybe detect/warn "duplicate process def"
- duplicate walls in a symbol seemed to cancel each other out
- tty resize while multiline input is broken again
- tty pause/resume should remember cursor position
- careful that world query doesn't "run twice at once"
  - e.g. by focusing window whilst ongoing?
- `Tabs` css should not reference src/const
  - try refactor `faderOverlayCss` e.g. merge into `<figure>`
- change camera fov based on camera height and/or visible-world
- Boxy rounding errors issue
  - https://boxy-svg.com/bugs/382/grouped-duplicate-then-snap-has-errors
- 🚧 memory leaks
  - ℹ️ use incognito to avoid extensions memory leak
    > https://superuser.com/questions/1843134/my-chrome-tab-memory-usage-increases-with-every-tab-reload-going-up-to-2gb-per-t
  - ℹ️ https://superuser.com/questions/1817473/what-accounts-for-the-discrepancy-between-the-memory-use-shown-when-hovering-on
  - ℹ️ can also use three.js stats UI which has a memory indicator
  - 🚧 interact, then take memory snapshot of both workers
  - geometry attributes are a possible memory leak
    - could update geometry attributes rather than create new attributes
      - see https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26835#issuecomment-1733180984
      - i.e. preset large bounds, and use geometry.setDrawRange
    - could use underlying gl api to remove attributes
WorldMenu log extras
  - permit resize (mobile too)
  - resize observer fits
  - checkboxes: pin ✅ show debug logs 🚧

- BUG obstacles.png slightly different onchange
  - no visible difference, probably due to "quick approach"
- verify HMR which propagates from assets -> geomorphs.json -> gmsData
- avoid connector re-computation i.e. extend serialization
- currently single quotes are breaking game-generators
- 🚧 Boxy SVG can be slow to save
  - https://boxy-svg.com/bugs/370/intermittent-slow-saving
  - 🚧 try replicate again in Chrome vs Incognito Chrome
  - 🚧 try turn off "FileVault" on Mac OS
- ✅ `w` command by itself should not throw
- syntax highlighting in the shell
  - https://github.com/wooorm/emphasize
  - for `declare -f foo`
  - for `PROFILE` via "hash-bang prefix"
  - for `/etc/game-generators.sh` via "hash-bang prefix"
- ignore certain tags e.g. `s`, `obsId`, `obstacleId`
- machinery less white
  - they have large white borders
  - try instance color

- prevent NPCs going through closed doors
  - i.e. color nav query
- ✅ use rapier physics 3d in web worker
  - i.e. static triggers

- next.js repo continued
  - migrate Viewer

- 🚧 more decor images
  - computer
  - speaker
  - communicator
  - fabricator
- place decor points on many tables
- more tables in 301
- more tables in 101
- verifyDecor inside CLI (previously did inside Decor)
- gatsby: somehow reconfigure `TerserPlugin` to exclude `npc-cli/sh/src/*`
  - already tried using extension `.min.js`
  ```js
  /**

  ```
- 🚧 🔥 sometimes during development restarting stops working,
  - can see 3d floor but console logs `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost`
  - observed that worker was not running
  - 🚧 try saving memory in web-worker, following recast-navigation-js
- TTY windows ctrl-c conflict: abort vs copy selection
  - take same approach as Windows itself
  - in Windows, when `this.xterm.hasSelection()`, ctrl-c should copy, not abort
- try leaving one logged-in window open before go offline, see how long it works
  > https://boxy-svg.com/questions/283/ability-to-use-while-offline
- distinguish symbols:
  - some extend beyond viewbox (e.g. stateroom),
  - some do not (e.g. table)
- ❌ static obstacles can specify color or shade
- tag `hull-wall` -> `wall hull`
- use decor cuboids under e.g. machines and desks

  - TestWorker was showing when Tab was minimized

- ✅ Can Esc/Enter to enable/disable in Terminal/Tabs
- ✅ Terminal rendered using WebGL
  - fix HMR via `npm i xterm-addon-webgl` https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/4757

- ✅ abstract `TestWorld` as `TestCanvas`
  - ✅ `TestCanvas` has generic prop `childComponent` e.g. `Scene` not `<Scene />`
  - ✅ `TestCanvas` has prop `sceneProps` to be used as `<Scene {...sceneProps} />`
  - ✅ create test scene `TestCharacter` and hook up to `Viewer`

- ✅ Fix remount issue
  - `TestScene` was exporting `customQuadGeometry` which broke HMR

- ✅ geomorph 301 position slightly wrong?

- ❌ start "GeomorphEdit" in TestWorld
  - ✅ `TestWorld` -> `TestWorldScene` in `TestCanvas`
  - ✅ remove `TestWorld`
  - ❌ start map-level UI with `HTMLSelectElement`s
  - ✅ THREE gridHelper -> single quad infiniteGridHelper
    - fix jsx type
  - ❌ can detect click geomorphs or hull doors
  - ℹ️ use SVG editor instead, rep gms as e.g. 1200 * 1200 boxes

- ✅ `TestCanvas` has div ContextMenu shown on LongPress or RMB
    - ✅ when click outside scene
    - ✅ when click on floor in TestScene

- ✅ Don't use a web worker, here's why:
  - `<NPC>` should use react-three-fiber
  - But then js representation `state` inaccessible from main thread
  - TTY code runs in main thread, so would need another rep + communication
  - More generally would have to wrap THREE in a communication API.
  - We can return to "web worker approach" once the project is more mature

- ✅ can layout map using SVG with geomorph placeholders (rects)
  - ✅ create example layout svg
  - ✅ `symbols-meta.json` -> `assets-meta.json`
  - ✅ parse maps and store in `assets-meta.json`
  - ✅ why is loaded map "in wrong position" ?
    - was referencing stale prop
  - ✅ `TestScene` reads from JSON and updates onchange
    - requires window refocus
  - ✅ avoid window refocus
    - ✅ can extend gatsby with dev-only endpoints
    - ❌ endpoint `GET /dev-events` (for EventSource) and `POST /dev-files-changed`
    - ✅ create websocket server and test browser connect
      ```js
      const url = "ws://localhost:8012/echo"
      const wsClient = new WebSocket(url)
      wsClient.onmessage = e => console.log('message', e)
      wsClient.send(JSON.stringify({ yo: 'dawg' }))
      ```
    - ✅ can trigger websocket via curl
      ```sh
      curl -XPOST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
        localhost:8012/send-dev-event \
        --data '{ "hello": "world!" }'
      ```
    - ✅ script assets-meta triggers websocket (if it exists)
    - ✅ browser triggers react-query refetch

- ✅ hull symbols have folder `symbols`, using placeholders
  - ℹ️ placeholders are partially transparent boxes of symbol filename's dimension
  - ✅ add stateroom symbol
  - ✅ extract during `yarn assets-meta`
  - ✅ maps: represent geomorph as single rect (via pattern)
  - ✅ clarify conversion { rect, transform } -> transform
  - ✅ compute affine transform we could apply to rect [0, 0, width, height]
    - ℹ️ want to eliminate rect.x, rect.y and transform-origin
      - let t_M be top-left of rect transformed under affine transform M
      - let t_S be top-left of [0, 0, rect.width, rect.height] transformed under 2x2 submatrix S of M
      - new affine transform is S plus translation (-t_{S,x} + t_{M,x}, -t_{S,y} + t_{M,y})

- ✅ maps parsing should support transform-origin too
  - ℹ️ can arise if rect starts with x, y attribs

- ✅ compute layout wallSegs in browser
- ✅ restrict doors in browser too
  - ✅ avoid origWalls i.e. store missing wall in symbol
- ✅ fix degenerate wallSeg
- ❌ show sub-symbol chairs, beds
  - ❌ use floating XZ planes
  - ℹ️ try single raised floor-sized texture
- ✅ changing map should change walls

- ✅ support optional walls e.g. `wall optional n`
  - ✅ `walls` does not include optional one
  - ✅ can add in optional ones based on sub-symbols

- ✅ avoid dev-server crash on save symbol to static/assets
  ```sh
  [1]   Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/Users/Robert.Myers/coding/np
  [1]   c-cli/static/assets/symbol/301--hull.svg.crswap'
  ```
  - ✅ store and read from media/symbols instead
  - ✅ still save to static/assets/assets-meta.json (so can fetch)

    - ℹ️ normals getting flipped again
    - ℹ️ seems need BufferGeometry per instance (bad)
    - ❌ try non-three API: recast-navigation/generators seems to block main thread
    - ✅ try @recast-navigation/three with BufferGeometry per instance, then dispose
  - ✅ move to web worker

    > It's the shader material you're using. Three materials have routines build in that handle instanced meshes, the instancing is done in shaders
    > You can piece a working shader together from 'shaderchunks', or modify an existing shader with material.onbeforecompile

    - `.25 * 5 = 1.25m` after scaling i.e. speed `1.25m / s` (24 frames, 24 fps)
  - ✅ run cycle root motion ~ 10m
    - root motion `.25 * 10 = 2.5m` after scaling
    - 20 frames -> 24 frames via scale `24 / 20 = 1.2`

    > `96 = 8 + (8*2*4) + 6*4`
    > i.e. head + (2 * arms + 2 * legs) + body
  - extras come from UVs i.e. need to duplicate vertex if has different UV
  - ✅ reduce to 241

  - ✅ obstacles has onPointer{Down,Up}
    - will decode actual obstacle hit later

  - ℹ️ a bit wasteful e.g. recomputing `w.gmsData` on HMR,
    i.e. could check whether `createGmsData` function has changed.

- ✅ synchronise data changes
  - ℹ️ i.e. geomorphs, mapKey, gms, gmsData, gmGraph, gmRoomGraph
  - ✅ verify HMR still working
    - ✅ map change

  - avoid confusion with `decorKey`
- ✅ decorKey -> decorImgKey
- ✅ decor.id -> decor.key


- ✅ Decor component
  - ✅ `<Decor>` exists
  - ✅ clarify identifiers
    - decorImgKey points into decor sprite-sheet

  - ✅ `gm.decor[i]` has keys like instantiated
  - ✅ fix cuboid instantiation when angle non-zero
  - ✅ track instantiated decor new/changed/removed
    - track per-geomorph only (not per decor)
  - ✅ efficient decor re-instantiation
    - e.g. if map stays same and decor too, won't redo
  - ❌ try absorb Decor query into root query (avoid partial)
    - ℹ️ even if we merge into root query, have to mutate
      `w.decor` over time because `decorGrid` is too large,
      so cannot "apply changes synchronously"
  - ✅ prefer to apply root changes first
  - ✅ ensure decor of removed geomorphs is also removed
    - currently works when gmId ≤ next max gmId
  - ✅ world is not ready until decor ready
  - ✅ world can become "unready" onchange e.g. map, hmr
    - i.e. `w.isReady()` false when `w.decor.queryStatus` not success

    - ✅ w.quads includes `decor poly`s
    - ✅ rotated rect 4-gon -> affine transform
      - need to know orientation of image
      - use "decor quad symbol" with axes pattern and dim 10x10
  - ✅ decor point induces quads
    - with fallback image `icon--001--info`
  - ✅ decor quad has fallback image
  - ✅ fix hmr on extend decor sprite-sheet
  - ✅ saw decor disappear when editing symbols

  - ✅ symbol instances apply to transform
  - ✅ use transform to position InstancedMesh instance
  - ✅ handle transform-origin


- ✅ fix sprite-sheet HMR
  - ℹ️ on add new symbol with obstacles
  - ℹ️ could fix with `yarn clean-assets && yarn assets-fast --all` + refresh
  - ℹ️ definitely data e.g.`geomorphs.json` or sprite-sheet, not program
  - ✅ could be problem with smart-sprite-sheet-update
  - ❌ could relate to adding symbol key to geomorph.js before we're ready?
  - ✅ visualise symbols graph i.e. media/graph/symbols-graph.dot
  - ❌ try repro with single geomorph
  - try fixing sprite-sheet size at 4096 x 4096 and see if re-occurs
  - 🤔 multiple websockets open in single browser tab?
  - ✅ saw issue onchange extant symbol i.e. remove some obstacles, add one symbol
    - ℹ️ this seems wrong 👉 `changedObstacles: Set(0)`
    - ✅ add `removedObstacles` and redraw sprite-sheet if non-empty
  - ✅ saw issue on WARN about mismatched size
    - `WARN medical-bed--006--1.6x3.6: extra--013--privacy-screen--1.5x0.2: unexpected symbol dimension`
  - ✅ saw out-of-sync, possibly Boxy SVG failed to save
  - ✅ saw issue on remove obstacle, then add back in
  - haven't seen any issues for a while, so closing

- ✅ remove `. ~/.bash_profile` from pre-push hook

- ✅ tty: `echo \'` should echo `'` (currently `\'`)
  - related to allowing single-quotes inside js (replace `'` -> `'\''`)
  - tryParseBuffer receives `["echo \\'"]` (which seems correct)
  - ✅ try interpreting Lit differently
- ✅ `SideNote` should wait a bit before showing
- tty should not render `NaN` as `null`
- `say` reading from tty should not terminate early when send a command before utterance finished
- ✅ `foo | map Array.from` failed because `Array.from` takes optional 2nd arg `mapFunc`
  - `map` recognises such cases does NOT pass `ctxt` inside `map` as 2nd argument
- ✅ fix `click 1` i.e. `click | ...` should not fire
- ✅ verify HMR which propagates from geomorphs.json -> gmsData


- ✅ fuel symbol can use single rect for wall
- ✅ thicker door ceiling tops
- ✅ `hull-wall` tag -> `wall hull`
- ✅ hull walls have `meta.hull` `true`

  - ✅ `useEffect` with worker.terminate suffices -- don't need react fast-refresh in worker
- ✅ changing props.mapKey should change map

- ✅ integer accuracy when parsing maps
  - Boxy has rounding errors e.g. when reflect
  - ℹ️ seems fixed after setting Boxy accuracy as maximum (attr + transform)
- ✅ fix case where `transform-box` is ~~`content-box`~~ or `fill-box`
  - https://boxy-svg.com/ideas/409/reset-transform-origin-points-svgz-export-option
  - ℹ️ seen in parseSymbol of hull symbol
  - ℹ️ fixed by updating sphere bounds
- ✅ smaller collapsed nav on mobile
- ✅ can press Escape/Enter to pause/unpause

- ✅ hull symbols should have same scale as non-hull symbols
  - ✅ resize-* 301 ✅ 302 ✅ 303 ✅ 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 103 ✅
  - ✅ careful about duplicating patterns i.e. only use `pattern-0`
  - ✅ replace files, whilst changing scaling i.e. always 1/5
  - ✅ issue with e.g. `<use width height transform="matrix(5, 0, 0, 5, x, y)">`
    - we used browser script (see `dev-info`) plus correctly manually
  - ✅ understand issue with obstacle sprite-sheet
    - 🔔🔔🔔 hull symbol image is scaled-up (unlike other symbols)
    - could add a scaled image, but might add to load time
- ❌ decor point bounds determined by original rect/poly

- ✅ start new branch `use-physics`
  - ✅ web worker with rapier
  - ✅ rapier has `stepWorld` function (untested)
  - ✅ rapier world has static colliders
    - request geomorphs.json and construct in worker
  - ✅ convert numeric ids into strings i.e. npcKey and gmDoorKey
  - ✅ rapier world has kinematic rigid bodies
    - ✅ spawn induces kinematic rigid body
    - ✅ remove npc removes kinematic rigid body
  - ✅ rapier world is stepped per-npcs-position update
    - don't bother trying to send "succinct array" (yet)
  - ✅ rapier triggers worker message on npc collide
  - ❌ could represent many doors as one rigid body e.g. per gm?
    - no need to try this
  - ✅ main thread sends numerical array(s)
    - ✅ do not detect agent vs agent collisions
      - seems already aren't being detected
    - ✅ method for assigning numerical ids to bodyKey/Meta
    - ✅ worker lookup restored on hmr
    - ❌ send array of npc uids which should go to sleep
      - rely on rapier to auto set bodies asleep
      - https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/rigid_bodies/#sleeping
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ doors open automatically when npc nearby
  - ✅ doors can be open/closed, locked/unlocked, manual/auto
  - ✅ doors can be sealed
  - ✅ track door -> nearby npcs
  - ✅ track npc -> door sensors e.g. for clean-up
  - ❌ toggle other hull door automatically
    - can open them individually
    - sensors already work
  - ✅ don't auto close door when npcs still within sensor range
  - ✅ clarify auto doors
    - ✅ do not auto-close when not auto
    - ✅ do not auto-open when not auto
  - ❌ manual doors are "blocked" inside nav query
    - we'll add physical switches for all doors, usable for manual
  - ✅ move worker handlers into WorldWorker
    - want handler edit to restart workers
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ tty: support recursive stringify of `Set` and `Map`
  - ✅ in tty.xterm output
  - ✅ `declare -x`
  - ✅ in shell expansion
  - ✅ separated shell function `pretty` into `pretty` and `json`
    - `pretty` is essentially `javascriptStringify` with indent 2
    - `json` is essentially `prettyCompact` and projects to JSON
      - e.g. does not support `Set`

- ✅ shell session: support restore Set and Map
  - ✅ serialize via `jsStringify` then re-evaluate
  - ✅ persist session on reset/unload
  - ✅ do not persist variable on run command (only on unload)

- ✅ service/npc -> service/helper
  - ℹ️ available runtime as w.lib.*
  - ℹ️ used by assets script
  - ✅ move key defs into helper
    - avoids totally rebuilding geomorphs.json
  - ✅ helper file should trigger watch script

- ✅ can pipe `w.events` into shell
  - ✅ define `events` in game-generators.js
  - ✅ better error messages on mvdan parse error

- ✅ fix restart while `events | map key`
  - ℹ️ pipe child terminated late, triggering pid 0 cleanups, cancelling next awaitWorld
  - ℹ️ due to pipe semantics i.e. 30ms delay "to permit child cleanup setup"
  - ℹ️ need some delay (setTimeout `0`) e.g. for `take 3 | true` to terminate immediately
  - seems to be fixed, but somewhat hacky

- ✅ start new branch `refine-doors`

- ✅ decor cuboid shader: flipped cuboid has wrong normal/colour
  - ✅ use decor-quad symbol instead (neater)
    - didn't fix problem though
  - ℹ️ no, normals are fine
    - issue also happens when we simply translate stateroom 036
  - ✅ possibly fixed via mvCameraPosition

- ✅ clean extractGeom into `extractDecorPoly` and `extractPoly`

- ✅ clean Decor
  - ✅ can specify decor point via symbol (infer direction)
    - ✅ pattern: single arrow
    - ✅ replace `orient={degrees}` in one symbol
    - ✅ replace `orient={degrees}` for all
  - ✅ simplify cuboid nav outset
  - ✅ decor poly -> decor rect
  - ✅ decor circle can use `<circle>`
    - ✅ add missing iris valves
    - ✅ iris value uses `<circle>`
  - ❌ decor rect uses symbol

- ✅ every door has 2 switches (inner, outer)
  - ✅ some symbol has two switches
  - ✅ can rotate decor quad so in XY plane via `tilt`
  - ✅ efficient computation of "post-rotation-matrix"
    - e.g. via caching
  - ✅ door switches format: `decor switch={symbolDoorId} inner`
    - ℹ️ decor quad because using decor quad symbol
    - ✅ `inner` optional; `y=1 tilt img=icon--square` implied
    - ✅ `switch` localDoorId -> doorId on instantiation
      - ✅ remove switches when "parent door" is identified
      - ✅ for identified doors, assume both switches are `inner`
      - ✅ remove switches when "parent door" is removed
  - ✅ add to hull doors
  - ✅ add to other hull symbol doors
    - 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 301 ✅ 302 ✅ bridge ✅
  - ✅ on remove doors and resp switches, adjust other switches
    - ✅ when doors coincide
    - ✅ when doors are manually removed

  - ✅ fix fresher-036 switches

  - ✅ pre-existing issue with gaps around top of doors
- ✅ fix nav-mesh on edge of 303
  - ✅ fixed computeDoorway
  - ✅ cleaner approach?
- ✅ LOD: when zoomed out a lot try making ceiling tops more solid
  - ✅ when far: fill but no stroke
  - ✅ when far: improve "large monochrome areas" e.g. lifeboat
    - tag svg symbols with `broad`
  - ✅ clean + fix HMR
    - seems MapControls onChange prop already supports hmr
  
- ✅ fix npc `way-point` event
  - ✅ event extends { ...current, next }
  - ✅ fires at final waypoint
  - ✅ doors have small wall above them
  - ✅ wall meta should have roomId
    - increase resolution of hitTest canvas
  - ✅ try extending `Walls` with two quads per door
    - i.e. two degenerate "one-segment-walls"
  - ✅ clean
  - ✅ locked indicator could go in center
    - ✅ render them inside `Doors`
    - ✅ green unlocked, red locked
    - ✅ setup initially locked doors
      - 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 103 ✅ 301 ✅ 302 ✅ 303 ✅
    - ✅ preserve locked flag via "door lookup by center"

- ✅ doors are specified as `auto`
  - ✅ temporarily set all doors `auto` 
  - 101 ✅ 102 ✅ 103 ✅ 301 ✅ 302 ✅ 303 ✅
  - ✅ unsealed hull doors implicitly `auto`
  - ✅ unsealed non-hull locked doors default to auto
    - we're setting "public" unlocked doors as auto
    - but e.g. unlocked fresher door inside locked room is not auto
  - ✅ implement "force-open" navigation while we implement navQuery
    - ✅ move door/npc logic outside Doors
    - ✅ move toggleDoor/toggleLock into w.s (shared)
    - ✅ w.s.toggle{Door,Lock} -> w.s.toggle
    - ℹ️ force-opening is distinct from having a key
    - ❌ toggle door opts.force
      - can already set opts.access undefined
    - ✅ npc.strategy 'default' or 'forced'
    - ✅ temp npc.strategy default to 'forced'
  - ✅ fix lock indicator for hull doors
  - ✅ w.s -> w.es
  - ✅ simplify w.es.toggle e.g. expects gdKey
  - ✅ w.es.toggle -> w.es.toggleDoor, w.es.toggleLock

- ✅ physics body keys `npc {npcKey}`, `nearby {gdKey}`
- ✅ physics body keys `inside {gdKey}`

- ✅ BUG onchange mapKey in Viewer
  - ℹ️ w.gmsData was being disposed before it could be used
  - ✅ physics.worker cannot read `world`
  - ✅ Walls/Doors not visible

- ✅ hash refactor
  - ✅ support w.hash[gmKey] and clean up
  - ✅ w.hash[gmKey].{full,nav,decor}
  - ✅ avoid recompute hash.images
  - ✅ can remove hash.images
    - sheets now contains imagesHash
  - ✅ move hash computations to browser
  - ✅ remove w.decor.computeHash
    - w.decor.hash points to last seen w.hash
  - ✅ use gmKey nav hash to avoid clearing npcToRoom
    - ✅ WorldWorkers has state.hash so can compare
    - ✅ send changed gmKeys
  - ℹ️ maybe can improve via murmur, but wait for timings via notifications

- ✅ import icons directly into Menu
  - rather than using `components/Icon`
- ✅ tty: avoid deleting paused line if user has typed something

- ✅ change way tabs are disabled/enabled
  - ✅ initially disabled tty shouldn't run profile
  - ✅ initially disabled World should be greyed out
  - ✅ while disabled, switching to an as-yet-unseen tab should mount it
    - believe this was already working

- ✅ tty: better disabled mount
  - we show message: "initially disabled"
- ✅ tty while disabled can ctrl-c sourced
  - tried sourced by adding `sleep 10` inside game-functions.sh
  - ✅ can pause/resume even when initially disabled
  - ✅ fix pause then resume while initially sourcing
  - ✅ cannot ctrl-c while initially paused
    - ℹ️ on hmr when paused (after resume) get blank tty, but works if resume tabs

- ✅ refactor Terminal without pause/resume
- ✅ refactor Terminal: add pause/resume
- ✅ on hmr `TerminalSession` unpaused tty should reboot
  - ✅ reset state.booted e.g. -> state.ts.booted
- understand error message on restart Tabs with running tty in background
- ✅ init paused:
  - ✅ tty should not run profile
  - ✅ runs profile on resume
  - ✅ cannot be ctrl-c'd
  - ✅ hmr `Terminal` preserves "single line shown"
  - ✅ hmr `TerminalSession` should render `Terminal`
  - ✅ can enter/esc while init paused

- ✅ fix hmr onchange tty.shell while paused (init or not)

- ✅ svg tag `switch={doorId}` -> `switch` and rely upon relative order to doors
  - we convert `meta.switch` into a number during parse

- ✅ can ctrl-c profile while tty paused (not init)
- ✅ fix: do not unpause on ctrl-c while paused
  - this means we cannot start initially paused via enter

- ❌ try merge TtyWithEtc into Tty
- ✅ TtyWithEtc -> TtyWithFunctions simplify forwards props.functionFiles

- ✅ can use terminal whilst paused
  - ✅ can start typing
  - ✅ can ctrl-c out of running process

- ✅ BUG ctrl-c of `echo 'foo\r\n`
  - wrong prompt shown after ctrl-c
- ✅ World pauses in background
  - e.g. try `w npc.npc.rob.moveTo '{x:-6.43,y:0,z:7.3}'`
  - could potentially permit "pause override" in future (e.g. pause one World, not other)
- ✅ BUG scrolling back through history of `echo 'foo\r\n\r\n'` loses a newline
  - happens when scroll back just beyond it

- ✅ Tty: resize-clear-input should also blur xterm

- ❌ pause tty ui issues
  - ℹ️ on switch tab, terminal pauses, and when come back, unclear whether should just continue
  - ℹ️ on continue using terminal when paused, enter can immediately launch unseen command
  - ❌ link choice instead: [ unpause ] or [ debug ]
  - ℹ️ decided on overlay instead

- ✅ World: "enable all" and "debug" overlay
- ✅ Tty: "enable all" and "debug" overlay
  - ✅ overlay fader and buttons
  - ✅ clean away other approach
  - ✅ avoid props.onKey from triggering resize

- ❌ "enable all" is highlighted when hover fader
  - instead, it is always highlighted whilst paused

- ✅ optionally permit camera movement while World paused 
  - ✅ pause/play toggle in viewer controls
  - ✅ remove fader from Tabs
  - ✅ add fader to World
  - ✅ can initially enable via click anywhere
  - ✅ on disable World fades by default; click anywhere to unpause
  - ✅ World has camera icon
  - ✅ can move camera when clicked

- ✅ fire event when npc enters/exits a room
  - ✅ sensor in each doorway, triggered on leave
    e.g. `inside g1d3` vs `nearby g1d3`
  - ✅ update npcToRoom
  - ✅ fix entered-room triggering
    - ℹ️ seen "npc position" not in room when running through hull door
    - possibly exasperated by collider near g0d0?
  - ✅ enter-room ✅ exit-room ✅ enter-doorway ✅ exit-doorway ✅ enter-sensor ✅ exit-sensor ✅
  - ✅ on reload nav.worker, recompute w.es.npcToRoom
    - ❌ clear lookup, except for unchanged gmKeys
    - ❌ lazily compute e.g. `w.es.getNpcRoom('rob')`
    - ℹ️ expect dev to handle this e.g. be in debug mode World/Tty
    - ✅ recompute over time; if not in room set undefined and warn
    - ✅ witness re-computation, and npc outside all rooms
  - ✅ roomToNpcs[gmId][roomId] i.e. inverse of npcToRoom

- ✅ xterm.js selection bug with gold text
  - needed to upgrade to `@xterm/xterm`
- ✅ hmr: support gm-graph
  - can ignore gm-room-graph because shouldn't really change,
    i.e. any "related" methods should inside gm-graph instead
- ✅ hmr issue editing obstacle outline
  - seems fixed by always re-generating obstacle texture, irrespective of size change

- ✅ on reload physics.worker, clear w.es.{npc,door}ToNearby
- ❌ `nav-changed` event for code supporting level-editing
  - ℹ️ dev should pause World while editing nav
  - ℹ️ in 2-player, changing levels shouldn't depend on this event

- ❌ npc move strategy dictates different navQuery
  - ❌ `anywhere`: no restriction (except sealed)
    - ✅ only open non-auto if (a) about to go through, or (b) would intersect
    - ❌ fix case where already nearby then move into/thru doorway
  - ❌ `adjacent`: can only nav to adjacent rooms
    - ❌ prevent nav through locked/closed-non-auto doors via "enter inside"
  - `accessible`:
    - block non-auto closed doors (including locked)
    - block locked auto doors

- ✅ refactor `npc.s.permitNav` i.e. support only one "move strategy"
- ℹ️ "all access" (e.g. `/./`) replaces `anywhere`
- ✅ refactor access keys as regexs
- ✅ remove `npc.s.permitNav`
- ✅ w.e.moveNpc(npcKey, point)
- ✅ assuming all access
  - ✅ fix move into doorway when already nearby
  - ✅ fix move through doorway when already nearby
- ✅ npc move should also work when lack access to door
- ✅ no-access npc should not stop when going through auto door
- ✅ can avoid checking each corner if no intersect and further away
- ℹ️ no-access npc stops early when onEnterSensor
- ✅ clean

- ✅ locked doors should close when
  - ✅ nothing `inside` and no `nearby` npc moving
  - ✅ trigger check when nearby npc stops (currently only on exit nearby sensor)

- ✅ fix bug: cannot close door when npc nearby

- ✅ BUG: tty: xterm paste (fails when line is single newline)
  - pasted newlines are normalized as `\r`: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1382#issuecomment-380309962
```sh
# repro
w gms | split | flatMap 'x => x.rooms' | map '({ center }, { w }, i) => {

}'
```
- ✅ BUG: tty: xterm paste then historical up (cursor in wrong place)
  - changed pasting behaviour i.e. previously we ran each line upon encountering newline,
    but now we just insert into to input
- ✅ BUG tty: xterm: cursor should skip over \r (now we normalize as \r\n)

- ✅ BUG: tty: xterm delete from end (moves one line down)
  - commented out "Right-edge detection" in `setInput`
```sh
# repros
echo 'foo {
}'
echo 'bar {

}'
```

- ✅ Support SVG symbol syntax `y=wallHeight`

- ✅ `take n` exits with non-zero code when doesn't take everything
  - so this terminates `{ echo foo; echo bar; } | while take 1 >tmp; do echo $tmp; done`
  - ✅ BUG `seq 5 | while take 1 >pos; do pos; done`
    - seems we cannot handle chunks using this method

- ❌ BUG tty: xterm: delete inside multiline command
  - repro didn't work
```sh
# repro by deleting from !")👈
call '() => {
  console.log("Wowsers!")
}'
```

- ✅ measure ~200 npcs FPS with current setup
  - ℹ️ 120 FPS with 177 without agent
  - ℹ️ 120 FPS with 177 with agent

- ✅ investigate GPU object picking via 2 render targets written to by 1 fragment shader
  - ℹ️ PR where render targets first added to three.js:
    > https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/16390
  - ℹ️ can provide vertex indices via attribute, hence instanceId too
    > e.g. https://discourse.threejs.org/t/how-do-i-get-the-vertex-data-from-my-position-attribute-into-a-shader-with-a-datatexture/52041
  - ℹ️ https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_interactive_cubes_gpu.html
  - ℹ️ Asked question https://discourse.threejs.org/t/is-gpu-object-picking-possible-with-a-single-render/70228
    - if we use a single shader with 2 outputs, seems we need a render target with 2 textures,
      and our "main scene" would be a full-screen quad, which breaks r3f pointer events
  - ℹ️ could re-use main scene as "picking scene" with different picking materials,
    - https://github.com/bzztbomb/three_js_gpu_picking/blob/main/src/gpupicker.js
    - need to extend approach to support instancedmesh e.g. via extra attribute
    - could avoid different shaders via boolean uniform

- ✅ towards gpu object picking: get walls working
  - ✅ Walls shader has own monochrome shader
  - ✅ Walls shader has boolean uniform `objectPicking` and behaves differently based on it
  - ✅ Walls shader has `gmId` attribute
  - ✅ Walls shader has `wallSegId` attribute
  - ✅ decode clicked pixel when shader turned on
  - ✅ fix hull wall z-fighting
    - ℹ️ object-picking issue (not visually where every wall black)
    - ❌ could omit/set-height-0 "outer overlapping walls"
      - too complex
    - ✅ manually inset outer hull walls slightly  
  - ✅ async read pixel
  - ✅ tidy: still running atm, will extend bit-by-bit

- ✅ can dynamically add to label sprite-sheet
  - ℹ️ `w update 'w => w.decor.showLabels = true'`
  - ✅ move `w.decor.label.quad` to `w.decor.labelQuad`
  - ✅ move `w.decor.{label,ensureLabelSheet}` to `w.label`
  - ❌ can incrementally extend
    - doesn't necessarily keep previous rects in same position
    - so, decor label uvs need to be recomputed
  - ✅ two label textures i.e. decor, npc (dynamic)
    - ✅ w.label -> w.decor.label
    - ✅ w.label -> w.npc.label
    - ✅ w.npc.updateLabels(["foo", "bar", "baz"])

- ✅ WorldMenu log should be a partially transparent xterm
  - ❌ use `BaseTty` but readonly
  - ✅ use vanilla `@xterm/xterm` Terminal i.e. `Logger`
  - ✅ clean up

    - ✅ selector has smaller radius
    - ❌ label text has outline
    - ✅ shadow circular
    - ✅ fix body uv-map
      - ✅ boxy SVG: sketch out more efficient uv-map (0.4 cuboid head, 0.4 * 1 * 1 body)
      - ℹ️ cannot avoid dup vertices: 8 + (3 * 16) = 60
        - https://stackoverflow.com/a/76713671/2917822
      - ✅ redo uv-map using above as guide
    - ✅ change vertex ordering: head < body < selector < shadow < label
      - ℹ️ head < body < selector < shadow < label
        - 60 vertices in total (after 3 * - for cuboid vertices)
        - `head` 3 * 8 [0, 23] < `body` 3 * 8 [24, 47] < `selector` 4 [48, 51] * < `shadow` 4 [52, 55] < `label` 4 [56, 59]
      - ✅ selector < shadow < label via: `p` (key), select in "right-order", re-join (object > join)
    - ✅ head < body < shadow < selector < label
    - ✅ body has icon
      - ℹ️ boxy: cmd+shift to scale uniformly to center 
      - ✅ center-front quad: head < body < shadow < selector < front-icon < label
    - ✅ can toggle selector/label
      - uniforms showSelector, showLabel
    - ✅ can change selector color
    - ✅ label higher so doesn't come through walls?
    - ✅ selector intersection problem
      - ✅ discard alpha < 0.1
      - ✅ higher, so drop shadow always beneath
  - ✅ control vertex ids in Blender
  - ❌ avoid 2 SVGs if possible i.e. uv-bg, tex
    - keep them separate e.g. can label "B-F" for body front
  - ✅ various different icons in character sprite-sheet
    - ℹ️ more in e.g. decor sprite-sheet

- ✅ bug: tty: `map 'x => 2 ** x'` then press delete

- ✅ support non-door sensor i.e. decor circle/rect
  - ✅ can manually add:
    ```sh
    w physics.worker.postMessage '{
      type: "add-colliders",
      colliders: [{
        type: "rect", width: 1.5, height: 1.5, x: 3, y: 7.5,
        colliderKey: "myTestCollider",
      }],
    }'
    ```
  - ✅ can detect collisions: `{npcKey: 'rob', otherKey: 'rect myTestCollider'}`
  - ✅ trigger events `enter-collider` and `exit-collider`
  - ✅ can remove
    ```sh
    w physics.worker.postMessage '{
      type: "remove-bodies",
      bodyKeys: ["rect myTestCollider"],
    }'
    w physics.worker.postMessage '{
      type: "remove-colliders",
      colliders: [{ type: "rect", colliderKey: "myTestCollider"}],
    }'
    ```
  - 🚧 decor circle/rect tagged `collider` induce colliders
    - ℹ️ decor key e.g. `rect[-21,0_01,30]` with meta.gmId and meta.collider
    - ✅ can provide `userData` in "add-colliders"
    - ✅ event `{ key: "gm-decor", type: 'updated', gmId }`
    - ✅ event `{ key: "gm-decor", type: 'removed-all' }`
    - ✅ simplify events i.e. only send one:
      - `{ key: "updated-gm-decor", type: "partial", gmIds }`
      - `{ key: "updated-gm-decor", type: "all" }`
        - clean not necessary, because world recreated?
    - ✅ events forwarded to physics worker
    - ✅ onchange decor rect (add meta.collider)
      - ✅ decor queryKey changed
      - ✅ "updated-gm-decor" emitted
      - ✅ `w.hash.gmHashes` -> `w.hash.mapGmHashes`
      - ✅ fix `{key:"updated-gm-decor",type:"partial",gmIds:[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]}` when only 301 changed
    - ❌ physics worker receives message
      - ℹ️ sending too early i.e. worker is being reset?
    - ✅ on reset worker world physics includes gm-decor
      - ℹ️ no need to forward event `updated-gm-decor`
      - ℹ️ wasteful i.e. could partially rebuild physics
    - ❌ events trigger:
      - removal of previous physics bodies with userData.{instanced,gmId}
      - creation of physics bodies with userData.{instanced,gmId}
  - ✅ support angled rect
    - ✅ can specify in `add-colliders`
    - ✅ can handle angled gm-decor rect
  - ✅ simplify add-colliders message
    - ✅ `rect` or `circle` rather than `cuboid` or `cylinder`

  - 🚧 improved idle animation
    - ℹ️ blender: next/prev keyframe: up/down
    - ℹ️ blender: slow down animation:
      - Scene > Output > Time Stretching > 100, 600
      - Given 24 frames (Start=0, End=22), End := 23 * 6 - 1 = 137
    - ℹ️ blender: scale frames by shifting to 1 and setting 1 as current frame
    - ℹ️ blender: center: shift + c

    when `saveCanvasAsFile`, so change text size instead

- ✅ bug: permitted npc going thru closed door
  - ❌ `state.isUpcomingDoor(npc, door)` is false when should be true
  - ℹ️ 301 npc starts near closed door of office, click adjacent stateroom

    w npc.npc.rob.setIcon null
    w npc.npc.rob.setIcon '{ uvMapKey: "cuboid-man", uvQuadKey: "front-label-food" }'
    ```
